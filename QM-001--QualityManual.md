# __NewInstitue__ Quality Manual
## QM-001
----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.0 PURPOSE

__NewInstitue__ is a health-sciences focused institute that designs and 
conducts *clinical investigations* by collecting human health data in order to
answer specific scientific questions.

This Quality Manual (QM) establishes the Quality Management System (QMS) for
__NewInstitue__.  Policies and procedures required for compliance are shown 
using the word **“SHALL”**.

This QMS complies with applicable sections of ISO-9001:2015, ISO-19011:2018, 
ICH E6(R2), ICH E8(R1), applicable Clinical Trials Guidance Documents published
by the FDA and international standards.

*Clinical Investigations* conducted by __NewInstitue__ are conducted in
accordance with this QMS and in a manner consistent with best practices.

This QMS adopts the definition of *Clinical Investigation* used in
[21 CFR 50.3(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-50/section-50.3#p-50.3(c))

>   Any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects
    and that either is subject to requirements for prior submission to the Food
    and Drug Administration under section 505(i) or 520(g) of the act, or is
    not subject to requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug
    Administration under these sections of the act, but the results of which
    are intended to be submitted later to, or held for inspection by, the Food
    and Drug Administration as part of an application for a research or
    marketing permit

## 2.0 SCOPE

This Quality Manual defines policies and procedures related to the design and
conduct of *clinical investigations* as defined by the US FDA in [21 CFR 50.3(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-50/section-50.3#p-50.3(c))

All __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors are required to adhere to the
policies and procedures outlined in this Quality Manual when designing and
conducting *clinical investigations*.

__NewInstitue__ does not perform *clinical investigations* of drugs, biologics,
or pharmaceutical products.  Therefore, the following standards and guidance
documents are not considered by this QMS

-   ICH E3: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports
-   ICH Q9: Quality Risk Management of pharmaceutical quality
-   ICH E2A:  Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting
-   FDA Guidance on Data Integrity and Compliance (2018)

Furthermore, __NewInstitue__ does not perform *clinical investigations* to asses
the performance, effectiveness, and/or safety of medical devices.  Therefore
the following standards and guidance documents are not considered by this QMS

-   ISO-14155: *Clinical investigation* of medical devices for human subjects

## 4.0 QMS OVERVIEW

### 4.1 General Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This QMS applies to *clinical investigations* designed and conducted by
__NewInstitue__. All __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors who are
involved in the design and conduct of *clinical investigations* are responsible
for understanding and complying with applicable provisions of this Quality
Manual (QM) and the __NewInstitue__ QMS. __NewInstitue__ Executive Management
is ultimately responsible for assuring that personnel can and do comply with all
provisions of the QM and the QMS.

The QM identifies several Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Work
Instructions (WIs). These SOPs and WIs identify activities, documents and
records to be produced as part of designing and conducting *clinical
investigations*. Documents may include specifications, study plans, reports,
etc. Records may include meeting minutes, test results, etc. and provide
evidence that activities required by SOPs have been performed.

__NewInstitue__ Executive Management is responsible for periodically assessing
the effectiveness of the QMS against defined quality objectives in order to
ensure __NewInstitue__'s *clinical investigations* are developed and conducted
in a manner consistent with the QMS and that its *clinical investigations* are
conducted ethically and produce high-quality, reliable scientific data.

The following processes have been identified as critical to the design and
conduct of ethical and reliable *clinical investigations*:

-   Design Controls
-   Document and Records Controls
-   Risk Management and Quality Risk Management
-   Computer System Validation, Data Integrity and Data Management
-   Outsourced Activities
-   Internal and External Audits
-   Training and Competency Management
-   Investigational Product Management
-   Subject Safety and Adverse Event Management
-   Monitoring and Oversight
-   Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)
-   Management Review and Quality Planning
-   Change Control
-   Regulatory Compliance Management

### 4.2 QMS Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation is the cornerstone of an effective QMS. __NewInstitue__
**“SHALL”** establish and maintain procedures for the control of documents and
records related to the design, conduct, validation and support of all
*clinical investigations* under this QMS.

The QMS documentation hierarchy is shown in Figure 1 and includes:

- This Quality Manual (QM)

- SOPs and WIs as required by this QM and applicable guidance documents and
international standards

- Study documents needed by __NewInstitue__ to ensure the effective planning,
operation and control of its processes

- Records required by SOPs and WIs

> ![](media/qm-fig1.png "")
> Figure 1 – Hierarchy of QMS Documentation

The purpose of each level of documentation is as follows:

-   The **Quality Manual** provides a description of the __NewInstitue__
    quality policy and the general structure and methods for maintaining
    the quality system. It provides policies, broad scopes of
    responsibilities and authorities. This QM establishes compliance
    with relevant regulations, guidance documents and
    international standards. It identifies requirements (indicated by
    the word **“SHALL”**) for creating SOPs, WIs, study documents
    and records.

-   **SOPs** are high-level procedures used to specify *what* needs to
    be done, by whom, when, and the records that are produced as
    evidence that the activity was executed as required.

-   **WIs** are detailed documents used to specify *how* some activity
    or operation is to be done, by whom, when it is done, and the
    records produced as evidence that the activity was executed
    as required.

-   **Records** provide evidence that activities prescribed in SOPs and
    WIs were performed.

-   **Study documents** are documents produced as part of clinical
    investigation design, conduct, and reporting activities. These may
    include protocols, case report forms, monitoring reports, safety reports,
    statistical analysis plans, and other documents based on individual study
    requirements. The specific documents to be produced are defined in the
    study plan/protocol.
