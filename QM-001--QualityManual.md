Documents published by the FDA.

*Observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__ are conducted in
accordance with this QMS and in a manner consistent with best practices.

An *observational study* is defined as only the control arm of a *clinical
investigation*

This QMS adopts the definition of *Clinical Investigation* used in
[21 CFR 50.3(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-50/section-50.3#p-50.3(c))

>   Any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects
    and that either is subject to requirements for prior submission to the Food
    and Drug Administration under section 505(i) or 520(g) of the act, or is
    not subject to requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug
    Administration under these sections of the act, but the results of which
    are intended to be submitted later to, or held for inspection by, the Food
    and Drug Administration as part of an application for a research or
    marketing permit
