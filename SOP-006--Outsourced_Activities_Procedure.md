subtitle: "SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure"

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
selecting, qualifying, contracting, and overseeing external organizations that
perform *observational study* activities on behalf of __NewInstitue__.
It ensures that outsourced activities maintain the same quality standards as
internally conducted work.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to the selection, qualification, contracting, and
oversight of external organizations that perform study-related activities on
behalf of __NewInstitute__ for *observational studies*.

For purposes of this procedure, "external organization" includes any person or
organization outside of __NewInstitute__ contracted to perform study-related
activities. The type and extent of controls applied to external organizations
shall be determined through risk assessment per
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md),
considering the potential impact on subject safety, data integrity, and study
validity.

This procedure does not apply to sponsor-investigator scenarios where
__NewInstitute__ personnel serve as the investigator; qualification
requirements for these scenarios are addressed under
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

This procedure also does not apply to operational monitoring of study conduct;
monitoring of protocol compliance, data quality, and subject protection for
all study activities (including those performed by external organizations and
their sub-contractors) is managed under
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md).

Vendor computer systems are subject to assessment under
[SOP-004: Computer System Validation, Data Integrity and Data Management Procedure](SOP-004--Computer_System_Validation_Data_Integrity_and_Data_Management_Procedure.md)
for validation status and data security controls.

Vendor-generated documents must comply with requirements in
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md)
and be maintained in the TMF.

Vendor-related risks are assessed using the framework in
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).

Audits of external organizations are conducted according to
[SOP-012: Internal and External Audit Procedure](SOP-012--Internal_and_External_Audit_Procedure.md).
This procedure defines when audits are triggered and how audit findings are
integrated into vendor performance management; SOP-012 owns the audit process
itself including planning, conduct, reporting, and follow-up.

Vendor performance issues may trigger [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md) or [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

### 4.1 Overview

This procedure covers identification and selection of external organizations,
qualification and due diligence assessment, Qualified Vendor List (QVL)
management, contract and quality agreement development, governance framework
establishment, vendor performance management against contractual obligations,
sub-contractor approval and flow-down of quality requirements, and
requalification and relationship termination.

__NewInstitute__ retains responsibility for oversight of all study-related
activities, including activities that a contracted external organization may
sub-contract to another party. This procedure establishes requirements for
approval of sub-contracting arrangements before engagement, flow-down of
applicable quality requirements to sub-contractors, and documentation of
sub-contractor relationships. Operational monitoring of sub-contracted
activities is performed according to
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md).

Governance activities under this procedure include kick-off meetings and
expectations setting, regular governance meetings, Key Performance Indicator
(KPI) tracking against contractual obligations, deliverable review and
acceptance, risk assessment and mitigation, and continuous improvement
initiatives.

While __NewInstitute__ may transfer study-related duties and functions to an
external organization, ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity
of study data remains with __NewInstitute__. All transfers of duties and
functions shall be specified in writing. Any duties and functions not
specifically transferred to and assumed by an external organization are
retained by __NewInstitute__.
