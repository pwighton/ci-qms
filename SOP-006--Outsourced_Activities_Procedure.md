subtitle: "SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure"

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes requirements for selecting,
qualifying, contracting, and overseeing external organizations that perform
*observational study* activities on behalf of __NewInstitute__.

This procedure ensures that:

- External organizations are qualified before performing study-related activities
- Written agreements define transferred duties and responsibilities
- Oversight is maintained throughout the engagement
- Quality standards are equivalent to internally conducted work

While __NewInstitute__ may transfer study-related duties and functions to an
external organization, ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of
study data remains with __NewInstitute__.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to the selection, qualification, contracting, and
oversight of external organizations that perform study-related activities on
behalf of __NewInstitute__ for *observational studies*.

For purposes of this procedure, "external organization" includes any person or
organization outside of __NewInstitute__ contracted to perform study-related
activities, such as clinical sites, investigators, laboratories, and service
providers.

External organizations are qualified on a study-by-study basis. The type and
extent of controls applied **SHALL** be proportionate to the potential impact
on subject safety, data integrity, and study validity, as determined through
risk assessment per
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).

This procedure does not apply to sponsor-investigator scenarios where
__NewInstitute__ personnel serve as the investigator; qualification
requirements for these scenarios are addressed under
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

Operational monitoring of study conduct (including activities performed by
external organizations) is managed under
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md).

Vendor computer systems are subject to assessment under
[SOP-004: Computer System Validation, Data Integrity and Data Management Procedure](SOP-004--Computer_System_Validation_Data_Integrity_and_Data_Management_Procedure.md).

Vendor-generated documents are controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md)
and maintained in the TMF.

Audits of external organizations are conducted according to
[SOP-012: Internal and External Audit Procedure](SOP-012--Internal_and_External_Audit_Procedure.md).

Vendor performance issues may trigger
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md)
or [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- External organization selection and qualification
- Contract and agreement development
- External organization oversight
- Quality assurance
