## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
closing out *observational studies* and archiving essential documents and study
records conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures proper completion of all study
activities, verification of Trial Master File (TMF) completeness, and long-term
retention of study documentation in compliance with regulatory requirements.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitue__ and addresses Phase 3 activities as defined in ICH E6(R2)
Section 8 (After Completion or Termination of the Trial).

This procedure covers:

- Study completion and termination activities
- Site closeout procedures
- Final study documentation and reporting
- TMF completeness verification and quality review
- Archiving of essential documents per ICH E6(R2) Section 8.4
- Long-term retention and retrieval of study records
- Transfer or destruction of archived materials

This procedure applies to studies that are:
- Completed as planned per protocol
- Terminated early (for any reason)
- Suspended indefinitely

Documentation of closeout activities is controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md)
with records maintained in the TMF.

Final study reports are developed using
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md)
principles for documentation quality and completeness.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Study conduct and operations
- Site management and closeout
- Data management and database lock
- Statistical analysis and reporting
- Regulatory affairs and compliance
- Quality assurance and TMF management
- Records management and archiving

### 3.3 Terms

-   **Study Closeout**: The systematic process of completing all study
    activities, finalizing documentation, closing study sites, and preparing
    the study for archiving.

-   **Database Lock**: The process of finalizing and securing the study
    database to prevent further data entry or modification, occurring after
    all data cleaning and query resolution is complete.

-   **Trial Master File (TMF)**: A collection of essential documents that
    individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a
    clinical investigation or observational study and the quality of the data
    produced.

-   **Archiving**: The process of long-term, secure storage of essential
    documents and study records in accordance with regulatory requirements.

-   **Essential Documents**: Documents per ICH E6(R2) Section 8 that permit
    evaluation of study conduct and data quality.

### 3.4 Acronyms

- **TMF**: Trial Master File
- **SAE**: Serious Adverse Event

## 4.0 STUDY CLOSEOUT PROCESS

### 4.1 Overview

Study closeout activities ensure systematic completion of all study-related
activities, proper documentation of study completion, and preparation for
archiving. Closeout activities differ depending on whether the study completed
as planned or was terminated early.

### 4.2 Triggers for Study Closeout

Study closeout **shall** be initiated when:

- All subjects have completed all protocol-specified activities (study
  completion)
- The last subject's last visit has occurred
- Target enrollment is reached and data collection is complete
- The study is terminated early by sponsor, regulatory authority, or IRB/IEC
- The study is suspended indefinitely

### 4.3 Site Closeout Activities

### 4.4 Database Lock and Final Data Analysis

### 4.5 Final Study Reporting

### 4.6 TMF Completeness Verification

### 4.7 Final Notifications and Communications

## 5.0 ARCHIVING

### 5.1 Overview

### 5.2 Archiving Requirements

### 5.3 Archive Location and Security

### 5.4 Retention Periods

### 5.5 Retrieval Procedures

### 5.6 Transfer or Destruction of Archived Materials

## 6.0 ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS FOR PHASE 3

Essential documents to be completed and archived at study closeout per
ICH E6(R2) Section 8.4 are detailed in [SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

## 7.0 TRAINING

All personnel involved in study closeout and archiving activities **shall** be
trained on this procedure and maintain documented evidence of training per
QM-001 Section 6.1.1.

## 8.0 RECORDS

Records generated under this procedure **shall** be maintained in the Trial
Master File (TMF) or archive per SOP-002.

Records **MAY** include but are not limited to:
- Site closeout visit reports
- Database lock documentation
- Final study reports
- TMF completeness verification documentation
- Final notifications to IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities
- Archiving documentation
- Retrieval logs
