subtitle: "SOP-005: Study Design Review Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the formal review and
approval process for *observational studies* designs developed by __NewInstitute__.
It ensures that study designs are systematically evaluated against scientific,
ethical, regulatory, operational, and quality requirements at defined decision
gates.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all formal review and approval of design activities of
*observational studies* at __NewInstitute__.

This procedure defines:

- **When** design reviews occur (review gates aligned with SOP-001 design phases)
- **What** is evaluated at each review (review criteria)
- **Who** participates in reviews (review perspectives and approval authorities)
- **How** reviews are conducted and documented (review process)

This procedure works in conjunction with [SOP-001: Design Controls
Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md), which defines the
development of study designs and design deliverables. SOP-001 specifies *what*
to create; this procedure specifies *how* to review and approve those
deliverables.

Reviews of changes to approved and active studies are conducted according to
this procedure, while the change process itself is managed under
[SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

## 4.0 REVIEW FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Overview

Design reviews are conducted at defined gates corresponding to the design phases
in SOP-001. Each review gate evaluates design outputs from the preceding phase
and determines readiness to proceed to the next phase.

The review framework consists of:

- **Six Review Gates**: Defined decision points aligned with SOP-001 phases
- **Eight Review Perspectives**: Disciplines contributing to design evaluation
- **Proportionate Application**: Review intensity scaled to study complexity and
  risk

### 4.2 Review Gates

The following review gates correspond to SOP-001 design phases:

| Review Gate | SOP-001 Phase | Purpose |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Concept Review | 5.2 Study Concept and Feasibility | Approve study concept and authorize protocol development |
| Protocol Review | 5.3 Protocol Development | Approve protocol and authorize detailed design |
| Design Output Review | 5.4 Statistical Planning + 5.5 Regulatory/Ethics | Approve design outputs and authorize verification |
| Verification Review | 5.6 Design Verification | Confirm outputs meet inputs; authorize validation |
| Validation Review | 5.7 Design Validation | Confirm fitness for purpose; authorize transfer |
| Final Design Approval | 5.8 Design Transfer | Authorize study initiation |

### 4.3 Review Perspectives

Design reviews incorporate input from multiple perspectives to ensure
comprehensive evaluation. The following perspectives are defined:

| Perspective | Focus Areas |
|-------------|-------------|
| Scientific | Research question, study objectives, scientific rationale, study design, endpoints, population |
| Statistical | Sample size, statistical methods, estimands, analysis plan, power, multiplicity |
| Operational | Feasibility, resources, timeline, site capabilities, recruitment, retention |
| Regulatory | Regulatory requirements, submissions, compliance, applicable guidance |
| Ethics | Subject protection, informed consent, IRB/IEC requirements, vulnerable populations |
| Quality | GCP compliance, data integrity, documentation, risk management, QMS alignment |
| Data Management | Data collection, CRFs, database design, data flow, validation rules, ALCOA+ |
| Safety | Subject safety, adverse event procedures, stopping rules, safety monitoring |

Not all perspectives are required at every review gate. Section 5.0 specifies
which perspectives apply at each gate. Additional perspectives may be included
based on study-specific needs.

### 4.4 Proportionate Application

Per ICH E8(R1) Section 3.2, review intensity **SHALL** be proportionate to:

- Study complexity and novelty
- Risk to subject safety and data integrity
- Regulatory requirements and intended use of data
- Organizational experience with similar studies

For lower-risk, straightforward studies, reviews may be streamlined by:

- Combining review gates where appropriate
- Reducing the number of required perspectives
- Conducting reviews via document circulation rather than formal meetings

The determination of appropriate review intensity **SHALL** be documented and
justified based on risk assessment per SOP-003.
