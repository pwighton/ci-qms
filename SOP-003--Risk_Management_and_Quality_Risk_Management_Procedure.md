## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
identifying, assessing, controlling, and monitoring risks associated with
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures that risks to
study participants, data quality, and study integrity are proactively managed
throughout the study lifecycle.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all risk management activities for *clinical
investigations*, focusing on study-related and quality risks.

Computer system and data-related risks are assessed under this procedure but
detailed validation and cybersecurity controls are managed under
[SOP-004: Computer System Validation, Data Integrity and Data Management Procedure](SOP-004--Computer_System_Validation_Data_Integrity_and_Data_Management_Procedure.md).

Risks identified during study design are initially assessed under
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md)
using the framework established here.

Risk-based monitoring plans developed under this procedure are executed
according to [SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md)

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees involved in:

- Study design and planning
