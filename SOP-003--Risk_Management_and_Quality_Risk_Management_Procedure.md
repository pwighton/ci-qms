---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
identifying, assessing, controlling, communicating, and reviewing risks
associated with *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures
that risks to study participants, data quality, and study integrity are
proactively managed throughout the study lifecycle in accordance with ICH
E6(R2) quality management principles.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all risk management and quality risk management 
activities for __NewInstitue__ observational studies. It establishes the 
framework for identifying, assessing, controlling, and reviewing risks that 
could impact study quality, data integrity, and participant safety.

This procedure defines the process for:
- Identifying and documenting Critical to Quality (CtQ) factors per 
  ICH E8(R1)
- Conducting risk assessments and creating the Risk Assessment Matrix
- Developing the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that determines monitoring 
  strategies
- Establishing Risk Indicators and Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs)
- Defining risk mitigation strategies and control measures
- Conducting periodic risk reviews and updates

Key deliverables from this procedure include:
- Risk Management Plan (defines WHAT to monitor and WHY based on risk levels)
- Risk Assessment Report/Matrix
- Critical to Quality Factors documentation
- Risk mitigation strategies that inform monitoring approach

The Risk Management Plan developed under this procedure serves as a primary 
input to [SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md), 
which executes the monitoring activities identified as necessary through risk 
assessment. Monitoring reports and KRI data generated under SOP-009 are 
reviewed under this procedure to assess whether identified risks are 
materializing or controlled as expected.

Study design considerations and protocol development follow 
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

Risk management documentation is controlled under 
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

Post-study risk management activities, including final risk
review and lessons learned, are aligned with study closeout
per [SOP-007: Study Closeout and Archiving Procedure](SOP-007--Study_Closeout_and_Archiving_Procedure.md).

Issues identified through risk management activities that constitute 
nonconformances are managed under [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming 
Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Corrective and preventive actions arising from risk assessments are managed 
under [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors 
involved in:
- Study management and planning
- Quality assurance
- Clinical operations leadership
- Data management
- Regulatory affairs
- Study feasibility assessment

## 4.0 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Overview

__NewInstitue__ implements a risk-based quality management approach in 
accordance with ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0 to ensure the protection of study 
participants and the reliability of study results. 

Risk management activities are integrated throughout the study lifecycle across 
three phases: before study conduct (Phase 1), during study conduct (Phase 2), 
and after study completion (Phase 3). These activities are embedded within the 
QMS and interface with multiple procedures including design controls (SOP-001), 
monitoring and oversight (SOP-009), and CAPA (SOP-011).

The principles underlying this framework are detailed in Section 4.2, roles 
and responsibilities in Section 4.3, and phase-specific activities in 
Sections 5.0 through 7.0.

### 4.2 Risk Management Principles

The following principles guide risk management activities for all 
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__:

#### 4.2.1 Proportionate Approach

The level of risk management activity **SHALL** be commensurate with the risks 
to participant safety and data integrity. Risk management efforts are scaled 
based on:

- **Study Complexity**: Simple observational studies with straightforward data 
  collection may use streamlined risk assessments, while complex multi-site 
  studies with multiple endpoints require comprehensive risk analysis.

- **Participant Vulnerability**: Studies involving vulnerable populations 
  (minors, cognitively impaired, economically disadvantaged) require enhanced 
  risk consideration.

- **Data Criticality**: Studies supporting regulatory submissions or public 
  health decisions warrant more rigorous risk management than exploratory 
  research.

- **Operational Challenges**: Studies with novel procedures, inexperienced 
  sites, or challenging logistics require proportionally greater risk 
  management focus.

#### 4.2.2 Critical Process and Data Focus

Per ICH E8(R1) Section 3.2 and ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.1, risk management 
**SHALL** prioritize Critical to Quality (CTQ) factors that are essential for:

- **Participant Protection**: 
  - Informed consent processes and documentation
  - Participant eligibility and enrollment procedures
  - Safety monitoring and adverse event detection
  - Participant privacy and confidentiality protections

- **Data Reliability and Integrity**:
  - Primary endpoint data collection and processing
  - Key secondary endpoint data
  - Source documentation practices
  - Data entry and verification procedures
  - Database lock and data transfer processes

- **Study Validity**:
  - Protocol compliance for critical procedures
  - Inclusion/exclusion criteria adherence
  - Visit windows and assessment timing
  - Completeness of critical data fields

The study team **SHALL** document identified critical processes and data in the 
Risk Management Plan, with clear rationale for their designation as critical.

#### 4.2.3 Risk-Based Decision Making

Risk assessment results **SHALL** drive resource allocation and quality 
management decisions throughout the study:

- **Monitoring Strategy**: High-risk sites, procedures, or data receive 
  increased monitoring frequency and depth, while low-risk areas may use 
  reduced or remote monitoring approaches.

- **Quality Control Measures**: Enhanced controls (double data entry, 
  additional training, independent verification) are implemented for high-risk 
  processes.

- **Resource Deployment**: Experienced staff, additional oversight, and 
  enhanced tools are allocated to areas of greatest risk.

- **Contingency Planning**: Formal contingency plans are required for high 
  risks that cannot be adequately mitigated.

Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs) **SHALL** be established for critical 
parameters per ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.3 to support objective risk-based 
decisions.

#### 4.2.4 Continuous Improvement

Risk management is an iterative process that evolves throughout the study 
lifecycle and across studies:

- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Risk profiles change as studies progress. The 
  framework **SHALL** support ongoing risk identification, reassessment, and 
  adjustment of control strategies based on:
  - Actual vs. expected study performance
  - Emerging safety signals
  - Site performance metrics
  - External factors (regulatory changes, public health events)
  - Monitoring and audit findings

- **Knowledge Management**: Lessons learned from risk outcomes **SHALL** be 
  documented and incorporated into:
  - Future study risk assessments
  - Updates to risk libraries and templates
  - Refinement of risk scoring methodologies
  - Training materials and best practices

- **Performance Metrics**: The effectiveness of risk management **SHALL** be 
  measured through:
  - Frequency of realized risks vs. predictions
  - Impact of mitigation strategies
  - Timeliness of risk identification
  - Resource efficiency in risk management

- **Process Refinement**: This procedure and associated tools **SHALL** be 
  reviewed annually and updated based on accumulated experience, regulatory 
  updates, and industry best practices.

### 4.3 Roles and Responsibilities
#### 4.3.1 Study Director/Principal Investigator
#### 4.3.2 Quality Assurance
#### 4.3.3 Study Team Members
#### 4.3.4 Risk Owner Responsibilities

## 5.0 PHASE 1: RISK MANAGEMENT BEFORE STUDY CONDUCT

This section defines the risk management activities performed
before study conduct begins, aligned with the Study Concept
and Feasibility (SOP-001 Section 5.2) and Protocol Development
(SOP-001 Section 5.3) design control phases.

### 5.1 Integration with Design Controls

Risk management activities **SHALL** be integrated with the
design control phases defined in
[SOP-001: Design Controls
Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md) to ensure
risk considerations inform study design decisions from inception
through approval.

Risk management activities progress through two stages aligned
with design control phases:

**Stage 1 — Preliminary Risk Identification (SOP-001 Section
5.2: Study Concept and Feasibility)**

During study concept and feasibility, the study team **SHALL**
develop an Initial Risk Management Plan that includes:

- Initial identification of critical processes and data
- Preliminary risk categories (safety, data quality,
  operational)
- High-level risk mitigation strategies
- Plan for comprehensive risk assessment during protocol
  development

The Initial Risk Management Plan is reviewed at SOP-005 Review
Gate 1 (Concept and Feasibility Review) before the study
proceeds to protocol development.

Activities supporting this stage are described in Section 5.2
(Initial Risk Identification).

**Stage 2 — Comprehensive Risk Assessment (SOP-001 Section 5.3:
Protocol Development)**

During protocol development, the Initial Risk Management Plan
**SHALL** be developed into a comprehensive Risk Management Plan
that includes:

- Complete risk assessment for all identified risks
- Risk scoring using the methodology defined in Section 5.3
- Mitigation strategies for all high and medium risks
- Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs) for critical parameters
- Risk-based monitoring approach
- Risk ownership and responsibilities
- Risk review and communication processes

The comprehensive Risk Management Plan is reviewed at SOP-005
Review Gate 2 (Protocol and Study Design Review) and verified
per SOP-001 Section 5.6 before study conduct begins.

Activities supporting this stage are described in Sections 5.3
through 5.7.

### 5.2 Initial Risk Identification

Initial risk identification occurs during the Study Concept and
Feasibility phase (SOP-001 Section 5.2) and produces the
Initial Risk Management Plan that is reviewed at SOP-005
Concept Review (Review Gate 1).

#### 5.2.1 Critical to Quality (CTQ) Factors

Per ICH E8(R1) Section 3.2 and ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.1, the
study team **SHALL** identify Critical to Quality factors that
are essential for:

- Participant protection (safety, rights, and well-being)
- Data reliability and integrity of study results
- Study validity

Section 4.2.2 provides examples of CTQ factors within each
category. The study team **SHALL** use these examples as a
starting point and identify additional CTQ factors specific to
the study.

CTQ factors **SHALL** be documented with:

- Rationale for their designation as critical
- Direct linkage to primary endpoints, key safety parameters,
  or regulatory requirements
- The critical process or data element associated with each
  factor

CTQ factors identified at this stage are preliminary. They
**SHALL** be reviewed and refined during comprehensive risk
assessment (Section 5.3) as the protocol and study procedures
are developed in greater detail.

#### 5.2.2 Risk Identification Methods

For each CTQ factor identified, the study team **SHALL**
identify risks that could impact the factor's integrity or
performance.

The study team **MAY** select risk identification methods
appropriate to the study's complexity and novelty. Methods to
consider include:

- Brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams
- Process mapping to identify failure points in study
  workflows
- Historical data review from similar studies (protocols,
  monitoring reports, deviations)
- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for systematic
  process analysis
- Checklists and templates based on regulatory guidance and
  organizational experience
- Site capability assessments to identify operational risks
- Stakeholder interviews (investigators, coordinators, data
  managers)
- Regulatory gap analysis against applicable requirements
- Review of protocol complexity factors (procedures,
  assessments, population)
- Technology and system risk assessments for EDC, ePRO, or
  other systems

The methods selected and the rationale for their selection
**SHOULD** be documented in the Initial Risk Management Plan.

#### 5.2.3 Risk Categories

At a minimum, the initial risk identification **SHALL**
consider the following risk categories for each CTQ factor:

- Safety and subject protection risks
- Data quality and integrity risks

Additional risk categories **SHOULD** be considered based on
study characteristics, including:

- Operational risks (recruitment, site performance, resource
  availability, timeline)
- Regulatory risks (compliance obligations, submission
  requirements, evolving guidance)
- Technical and system risks (EDC, data transfer, software,
  IT infrastructure)

#### 5.2.4 Initial Risk Management Plan

The outputs of initial risk identification **SHALL** be
documented in an Initial Risk Management Plan that includes:

- Initial identification of critical processes and data
  (CTQ factors per Section 5.2.1)
- Preliminary risk categories and identified risks per
  Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3
- High-level risk mitigation strategies for identified risks
- Plan for comprehensive risk assessment during protocol
  development, including planned methodology, timeline, and
  responsible personnel

The Initial Risk Management Plan is a design output of
SOP-001 Section 5.2 and **SHALL** be included in the TMF.

This plan **SHALL** be developed into a comprehensive Risk
Management Plan during protocol development per Section 5.5.

### 5.3 Risk Assessment

Risk assessment occurs during protocol development (SOP-001
Section 5.3) and refines the preliminary risks identified in
Section 5.2 into scored, prioritized risks with defined
acceptance levels.

The risk assessment methodology defined in this section is
based on the quality risk management principles described in
ICH Q9(R1) and implements the risk-based quality management
requirements of ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0. The specific scoring
scales, priority thresholds, and acceptance criteria are
defined by __NewInstitute__ to provide a consistent,
repeatable methodology appropriate for observational studies.

The risk assessment methodology **SHALL** be applied
consistently across all risks within a study. SOP-001
Section 5.6 verifies that risk scores are consistently applied
using the defined methodology.

#### 5.3.1 Likelihood (Probability) Scoring

Each identified risk **SHALL** be assessed for the probability
that it will occur during the study. Likelihood **SHALL** be
scored using the following scale:

| Score | Level        | Description                        |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| 1     | Rare         | Very unlikely to occur; no history of occurrence in similar studies |
| 2     | Unlikely     | Could occur but not expected; isolated occurrences in similar studies |
| 3     | Possible     | May occur; has occurred occasionally in similar studies |
| 4     | Likely       | Expected to occur; has occurred regularly in similar studies |
| 5     | Almost certain | Expected to occur frequently or is already occurring |

Likelihood scoring **SHALL** consider:

- Historical data from previous studies (deviation rates,
  monitoring findings, CAPA trends)
- Complexity of the process or procedure
- Experience and capability of personnel and sites
- Effectiveness of existing controls
- External factors (regulatory environment, population
  characteristics)

When historical data are not available, the study team
**SHALL** document the basis for the likelihood estimate
(e.g., expert judgment, published literature, analogous
studies).

#### 5.3.2 Severity (Impact) Scoring

Each identified risk **SHALL** be assessed for the potential
consequences if the risk materializes. Severity **SHALL** be
scored using the following scale:

| Score | Level       | Subject Safety Impact              | Data Integrity Impact              |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1     | Negligible  | No impact on subject safety or well-being | Minor data issue; no effect on study conclusions |
| 2     | Minor       | Minimal impact; no change to risk-benefit profile | Limited data affected; no impact on primary endpoints |
| 3     | Moderate    | Potential for reversible harm or increased burden to subjects | Data affected may impact secondary endpoints or subgroup analyses |
| 4     | Major       | Potential for serious or lasting harm to subjects | Primary endpoint data compromised for a subset of subjects or sites |
| 5     | Critical    | Potential for life-threatening harm, death, or widespread rights violations | Primary endpoint data compromised study-wide; study conclusions unreliable |

When a risk has the potential to impact both subject safety and
data integrity, the higher of the two severity scores **SHALL**
be used.

#### 5.3.3 Risk Scoring and Prioritization

An overall risk score **SHALL** be calculated for each
identified risk as:

> **Risk Score = Likelihood × Severity**

Risk scores range from 1 to 25 and **SHALL** be classified
into the following priority levels:

| Risk Score | Priority Level | Required Action                  |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 1–4        | Low            | Accept or monitor; document rationale for acceptance |
| 5–9        | Medium         | Mitigation **SHOULD** be implemented; risk **SHALL** be monitored |
| 10–16      | High           | Mitigation **SHALL** be implemented before study conduct begins |
| 17–25      | Critical       | Mitigation **SHALL** be implemented; residual risk **SHALL** be reviewed and accepted per Section 5.3.4 before study conduct begins |

All risk scores **SHALL** be documented in the Risk Register
(Section 5.5.3) with supporting rationale for the likelihood
and severity scores assigned.

Studies **MAY** incorporate Detectability as a third scoring
factor when the ability to detect a risk before it causes
significant impact varies substantially across risks. When
used, the three-factor scoring methodology and adjusted
priority thresholds **SHALL** be documented in the Risk
Management Plan.

#### 5.3.4 Risk Acceptance Criteria

Residual risk remaining after mitigation (or initial risk when
no mitigation is planned) **SHALL** be evaluated against the
following acceptance criteria:

| Priority Level | Acceptance Authority               | Requirements                       |
|----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Low            | Risk Owner                         | Document acceptance rationale in Risk Register |
| Medium         | Study Director or Principal Investigator | Document acceptance rationale and confirm monitoring controls are in place |
| High           | Study Director or Principal Investigator with Quality Assurance review | Document acceptance rationale, confirm mitigation is in place, and establish monitoring indicators |
| Critical       | Study Director or Principal Investigator with Quality Assurance and Executive Management approval | Document detailed justification; confirm all feasible mitigations are implemented; establish QTLs and enhanced monitoring; document contingency plan |

A risk **SHALL NOT** be accepted if:

- The residual risk to subject safety is unacceptable
  regardless of potential study benefit
- Regulatory requirements mandate that the risk be eliminated
  or reduced

Risk acceptance decisions **SHALL** be documented in the Risk
Register and included in the Risk Management Plan. Changes to
risk acceptance decisions during study conduct **SHALL** follow
the risk reassessment process defined in Section 6.2.

### 5.4 Risk Control Planning

For each risk scored in Section 5.3 that requires mitigation,
the study team **SHALL** develop risk control measures and
document them in the Risk Register (Section 5.5.3) and the
Risk Management Plan (Section 5.5).

Risk control planning **SHALL** follow the control hierarchy
described in ICH Q9(R1): risk controls should first seek to
reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring (preventive
controls), and then ensure that the risk is detected promptly
if it does occur (detective controls). Contingency plans
address the consequences when prevention and detection are
insufficient.

Risk controls **SHALL** be proportionate to the priority level
assigned in Section 5.3.3. As a minimum:

| Priority Level | Required Controls                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Low            | Monitoring through routine study oversight; additional controls optional |
| Medium         | At least one preventive or detective control; risk monitored through indicators |
| High           | Preventive and detective controls **SHALL** both be defined; risk indicators and thresholds established |
| Critical       | Preventive and detective controls **SHALL** both be defined; contingency plan **SHALL** be documented; QTL established per Section 5.6.2 |

#### 5.4.1 Risk Mitigation Strategies

For each risk requiring mitigation, the study team **SHALL**
select one or more of the following strategies:

- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by modifying the study design,
  procedures, or data collection approach to remove the source
  of risk. Changes to study design **SHALL** be coordinated
  with protocol development per SOP-001 Section 5.3.
- **Reduce**: Implement controls that decrease the likelihood
  or severity of the risk to an acceptable level.
- **Transfer**: Assign the activity giving rise to the risk to
  a qualified external organization with demonstrated
  capability to manage it, per
  [SOP-006: Outsourced Activities
  Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).
  Transfer of an activity does not transfer accountability;
  oversight **SHALL** be maintained per SOP-006 and SOP-009.
- **Accept**: Accept the risk at its current level when it
  falls within the acceptance criteria defined in
  Section 5.3.4. Accepted risks **SHALL** still be documented
  and monitored.

The selected strategy **SHALL** be documented in the Risk
Register with rationale for the approach chosen.

#### 5.4.2 Preventive Controls

Preventive controls are proactive measures implemented before
or at the start of study conduct to reduce the likelihood of a
risk occurring.

For each risk requiring preventive controls, the study team
**SHALL** document:

- Description of the control measure
- The risk or risks it addresses
- When the control is to be implemented (before study start,
  at site initiation, ongoing)
- Responsible person or role

Examples of preventive controls include:

- Protocol-specific training for site personnel
- Eligibility verification checklists or automated checks
- System validations and access controls per SOP-004
- Standardized data collection instruments and procedures
- Clear procedural instructions in the protocol or site manual
- Qualification requirements for sites or personnel per
  SOP-006

#### 5.4.3 Detective Controls

Detective controls are monitoring and review mechanisms
designed to identify when risks are materializing so that
corrective action can be taken promptly.

For each risk requiring detective controls, the study team
**SHALL** document:

- Description of the detection mechanism
- The risk or risks it is intended to detect
- Frequency or timing of the detection activity
- Responsible person or role
- Escalation path when the control signals an issue

Detective controls documented in this section inform the
monitoring approach developed in Section 5.6 and
operationalized in the Monitoring Plan per SOP-009.

Examples of detective controls include:

- Centralized data review and statistical monitoring
- Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) with defined thresholds
- Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs) for critical parameters
  (Section 5.6.2)
- On-site monitoring and source data verification
- Periodic audit activities per SOP-012
- Automated system alerts and edit checks

#### 5.4.4 Contingency Planning

Contingency plans **SHALL** be documented for all critical
priority risks and **SHOULD** be considered for high priority
risks where the consequences of the risk materializing would
be difficult to reverse.

For each risk requiring a contingency plan, the study team
**SHALL** document:

- The trigger condition or conditions that activate the
  contingency plan
- Predetermined response actions
- Responsible person or role for activating and executing the
  plan
- Communication requirements (who is notified and when)
- Criteria for determining when the contingency situation is
  resolved

Examples of contingency plans include:

- Backup data collection methods if primary systems fail
- Alternative sites or recruitment strategies if enrollment
  targets are not met
- Predefined responses to safety signals requiring protocol
  modification
- Data recovery procedures for system failures

#### 5.4.5 Residual Risk Evaluation

After risk controls are defined, the study team **SHALL**
reassess each mitigated risk to determine the residual risk
score.

Residual risk **SHALL** be scored using the same likelihood and
severity scales defined in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, with
likelihood adjusted to reflect the expected effect of the
planned controls.

Residual risk scores **SHALL** be documented in the Risk
Register alongside the initial risk scores. Residual risk
**SHALL** be evaluated against the acceptance criteria in
Section 5.3.4.

If residual risk remains above the acceptable level after all
feasible controls have been defined, the risk **SHALL** be
escalated per the acceptance authority requirements in
Section 5.3.4. The study team **SHALL** document the
justification for proceeding with the residual risk, including
an assessment of whether the risk is outweighed by the
expected study benefit.

### 5.5 Risk Management Plan Development

The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is the comprehensive document
that consolidates the outputs of Sections 5.2 through 5.4 and
defines the approach for risk monitoring (Section 5.6) and
risk communication (Section 5.7) for a specific study.

The RMP is a design output of protocol development (SOP-001
Section 5.3) and **SHALL** be reviewed at SOP-005 Review
Gate 2 (Protocol and Study Design Review) and verified per
SOP-001 Section 5.6 before study conduct begins.

The RMP is a controlled document subject to
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls
Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).
Changes to the RMP after initial approval **SHALL** follow
[SOP-013: Change Control
Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

#### 5.5.1 Risk Management Plan Contents

The RMP **SHALL** include, at a minimum:

- **Study identification**: Study title, protocol number, and
  version history of the RMP
- **Risk management approach**: Description of the risk
  assessment methodology used, including scoring scales and
  priority thresholds (per Section 5.3) and any study-specific
  tailoring (per Section 5.5.2)
- **Critical to Quality factors**: Identified CTQ factors with
  rationale for their designation (per Section 5.2.1)
- **Risk assessment summary**: Summary of identified risks,
  likelihood and severity scores, and priority levels
  (per Section 5.3)
- **Risk control measures**: Mitigation strategies, preventive
  controls, detective controls, and contingency plans for each
  risk requiring mitigation (per Section 5.4)
- **Residual risk evaluation**: Residual risk scores after
  planned controls, with acceptance decisions and approvals
  (per Sections 5.4.5 and 5.3.4)
- **Quality Tolerance Limits**: QTLs for critical parameters
  with defined thresholds and response actions
  (per Section 5.6.2)
- **Risk indicators**: Key Risk Indicators and thresholds for
  ongoing monitoring (per Section 5.6.4)
- **Risk-based monitoring approach**: Description of how risk
  levels inform monitoring intensity and focus, serving as the
  primary input to the Monitoring Plan developed per SOP-009
- **Risk ownership**: Assignment of Risk Owners for each
  identified risk (per Section 4.3.4)
- **Risk review schedule**: Planned frequency and triggers for
  risk reassessment during study conduct (per Section 6.1)
- **Risk communication plan**: Stakeholders, frequency, and
  channels for risk communication (per Section 5.7)

These contents correspond to the verification criteria defined
in SOP-001 Section 5.6 (Risk Management Plan Verification).

#### 5.5.2 Tailoring the Risk Management Plan

Studies **MAY** tailor the RMP to suit study-specific needs,
provided the following core requirements are maintained:

- All elements listed in Section 5.5.1 **SHALL** be addressed
- The risk assessment methodology **SHALL** use the scoring
  scales and priority thresholds defined in Section 5.3, or
  document and justify any study-specific modifications
  (e.g., addition of a Detectability factor per
  Section 5.3.3)
- CTQ factors **SHALL** be identified per ICH E8(R1)
  Section 3.2
- QTLs **SHALL** be established for critical parameters per
  ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.3
- Risk ownership **SHALL** be assigned for all risks at
  medium priority or above

Tailoring decisions **SHALL** be documented in the RMP with
rationale. Tailoring **SHALL NOT** reduce the scope of risk
assessment below the minimum risk categories defined in
Section 5.2.3.

#### 5.5.3 Risk Register

The Risk Register is the detailed, study-specific record that
tracks each identified risk throughout the study lifecycle. It
is maintained as a companion document to the RMP and updated
as risks are identified, reassessed, or closed.

The Risk Register **SHALL** contain the following information
for each identified risk:

- Unique risk identifier
- Date identified
- Associated CTQ factor (per Section 5.2.1)
- Risk category (per Section 5.2.3)
- Risk description
- Likelihood score with rationale (per Section 5.3.1)
- Severity score with rationale (per Section 5.3.2)
- Overall risk score and priority level (per Section 5.3.3)
- Risk control strategy and specific control measures
  (per Section 5.4)
- Residual risk score after controls (per Section 5.4.5)
- Risk acceptance decision and approval authority
  (per Section 5.3.4)
- Risk Owner
- Associated risk indicators or QTLs (if applicable)
- Current status (open, mitigated, accepted, closed)
- Date of last review

The Risk Register **SHALL** be version controlled per SOP-002.
Historical versions **SHALL** be retained to provide a
complete record of how the risk profile evolved throughout the
study.

The Risk Register is updated during periodic and triggered
risk reviews per Section 6.0 and finalized at study closeout
per Section 7.0.

### 5.6 Risk-Based Monitoring Strategy

This section defines how risk assessment outputs are
translated into a monitoring strategy that serves as the
primary input to the Monitoring Plan developed per
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight
Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md).

SOP-003 defines *what* needs monitoring, *why* it needs
monitoring (based on risk levels), and *what thresholds*
signal that action is needed. SOP-009 translates these inputs
into the operational Monitoring Plan that specifies *how*
monitoring is conducted, *who* conducts it, and *when* it
occurs.

The risk-based monitoring strategy **SHALL** be documented in
the Risk Management Plan (Section 5.5) and provided to the
monitoring team as a design input for Monitoring Plan
development.

#### 5.6.1 Linking Risks to Monitoring Focus Areas

The study team **SHALL** identify which risks and CTQ factors
require active monitoring during study conduct. Not all
identified risks require dedicated monitoring indicators;
some are adequately addressed through preventive controls
alone (per Section 5.4.2).

For each risk that requires monitoring, the study team
**SHALL** document in the Risk Management Plan:

- The risk and associated CTQ factor
- The rationale for requiring active monitoring (e.g., risk
  cannot be fully prevented, residual risk requires ongoing
  surveillance, ICH E6(R2) requires monitoring of the
  parameter)
- The type of monitoring indicator to be used (QTL, KRI, or
  other metric)
- The data source for the indicator

At a minimum, active monitoring **SHALL** be established for:

- All risks at high or critical priority level
  (per Section 5.3.3) where detective controls were identified
  (per Section 5.4.3)
- All parameters for which QTLs are established
  (per Section 5.6.2)
- All CTQ factors related to subject safety

#### 5.6.2 Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs)

Per ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.3, QTLs **SHALL** be established
for critical parameters to facilitate the detection of
systematic issues that could affect subject safety or data
integrity.

QTLs are study-level thresholds. When a QTL is exceeded, it
signals a potential systematic issue requiring evaluation,
not necessarily a confirmed problem. QTL exceedances trigger
the evaluation process described below; they do not
automatically constitute nonconformances under SOP-010.

For each QTL, the study team **SHALL** document:

- **Parameter**: The specific quality parameter being measured
  (e.g., rate of missing primary endpoint data, informed
  consent error rate, query resolution time)
- **Associated CTQ factor and risk**: The CTQ factor and risk
  from the Risk Register that the QTL monitors
- **Threshold value**: The specific, measurable limit that
  triggers evaluation (e.g., >10% missing primary endpoint
  data across all sites, >5% informed consent deviations at
  any single site)
- **Measurement method**: How the parameter is calculated,
  including the data source, numerator, denominator, and
  measurement frequency
- **Evaluation process**: The steps to be taken when the
  threshold is exceeded, including:
  - Who is responsible for conducting the evaluation
  - The timeframe for initiating evaluation
  - Factors to consider in determining whether a systematic
    issue exists
  - Possible outcomes (no action required with documented
    rationale, corrective action, risk reassessment,
    escalation to SOP-010 or SOP-011)
- **Reporting**: How QTL status is communicated to the
  monitoring team (per SOP-009) and to study management

QTLs **SHALL** be established for at least the following
parameter categories, unless the study team documents a
justified rationale for exclusion:

- Primary endpoint data completeness
- Informed consent compliance
- Eligibility criteria adherence
- Safety reporting timeliness (per SOP-008)

QTLs may be established at the study level, the site level,
or both, as appropriate for the parameter. The level at which
each QTL operates **SHALL** be documented.

QTLs may be revised during study conduct when data
demonstrate that thresholds are not appropriately calibrated.
Revisions **SHALL** follow the risk reassessment process in
Section 6.0 and be documented in the Risk Register and Risk
Management Plan.

#### 5.6.3 Risk-Based Monitoring Intensity Levels

The Risk Management Plan **SHALL** define monitoring intensity
levels that correspond to the risk priority levels established
in Section 5.3.3. These intensity levels inform the Monitoring
Plan developed per SOP-009 by indicating the degree of
monitoring attention each risk area warrants.

The following intensity levels **SHALL** be defined, at a
minimum:

- **Standard monitoring**: Applicable to low priority risks.
  Routine oversight through standard centralized data review
  and scheduled monitoring activities as defined in the
  Monitoring Plan.
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Applicable to medium priority risks.
  Increased frequency or depth of data review, additional
  KRI tracking, or more frequent site communication beyond
  standard activities.
- **Intensive monitoring**: Applicable to high and critical
  priority risks. Frequent and focused monitoring activities,
  which may include targeted centralized analyses, increased
  source data verification, or on-site monitoring visits as
  determined appropriate in the Monitoring Plan.

The Risk Management Plan **SHALL** assign an initial
monitoring intensity level to each risk requiring active
monitoring (per Section 5.6.1). SOP-009 translates these
intensity levels into specific monitoring methods, frequencies,
and resource assignments in the Monitoring Plan.

Monitoring intensity **MAY** be adjusted during study conduct
based on risk reassessment findings (per Section 6.0).
Adjustments are communicated to the monitoring team per
Section 6.3.3 and documented as Monitoring Plan adaptations
per SOP-009 Section 4.6.

#### 5.6.4 Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Key Risk Indicators are quantitative or qualitative metrics
that provide ongoing information about the current state of
identified risks. KRIs complement QTLs by providing
trend-level visibility into risk areas, enabling early
detection of emerging issues before QTL thresholds are
reached.

For each risk requiring a KRI, the study team **SHALL**
document:

- **Indicator name and description**: Clear definition of what
  is being measured
- **Associated risk and CTQ factor**: The risk from the Risk
  Register that the KRI monitors
- **Calculation method**: How the indicator is derived,
  including data source, formula, and unit of measurement
- **Reporting frequency**: How often the KRI is calculated and
  reported
- **Thresholds**: Defined levels that signal when attention
  or action is needed. Thresholds **SHOULD** include:
  - An alert threshold indicating a trend warranting closer
    observation
  - An action threshold indicating a level warranting
    investigation or intervention
- **Response actions**: What happens when each threshold is
  reached, including who is responsible for evaluation

KRIs **SHALL** be established for all risks at high or
critical priority level. KRIs **SHOULD** be considered for
medium priority risks where trend monitoring would provide
meaningful early warning.

KRI definitions, thresholds, and reporting frequency are
documented in the Risk Management Plan and provided to the
monitoring team for operational implementation in the
Monitoring Plan per SOP-009. KRI data collected during study
conduct are reviewed as part of the risk review process
defined in Section 6.0.

### 5.7 Risk Communication

Effective risk communication ensures that stakeholders have
the information they need to fulfill their responsibilities
for risk management and study quality. This section defines
the communication plan established before study conduct
begins. Communication of risk updates during study conduct is
addressed in Sections 6.1.3 and 6.3.3.

The risk communication plan **SHALL** be documented in the
Risk Management Plan (Section 5.5).

#### 5.7.1 Stakeholder Communication

The study team **SHALL** identify stakeholders who need to
receive risk information and define communication
requirements for each. At a minimum, the following
stakeholders **SHALL** be addressed:

| Stakeholder | Information to Communicate | Frequency |
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Study Director / Principal Investigator | Full risk profile, risk review outcomes, QTL and KRI status, escalations requiring decision | At each scheduled risk review (per Section 6.1) and upon triggered reassessment (per Section 6.2) |
| Quality Assurance | Risk assessment results, QTL exceedances, nonconformance trends, CAPA-related risk updates | At each scheduled risk review and as issues arise |
| Monitoring Team | Risk levels, CTQ factors, QTLs, KRI thresholds, and any changes to these during study conduct | Before study initiation (as input to Monitoring Plan per SOP-009) and upon any update per Section 6.3.3 |
| Site Personnel | Risks relevant to site-level activities, required risk controls, and any changes to study procedures driven by risk findings | At site initiation (per SOP-009 Section 4.3) and as needed during study conduct |
| Executive Management | Summary risk status, critical and high priority risk trends, escalations per Section 5.3.4 | As input to annual Management Review (per QM-001 Section 5.3.3) and upon critical risk escalations |

Studies **MAY** identify additional stakeholders based on
study-specific needs (e.g., data safety monitoring boards,
IRB/IEC, external partners per SOP-006).

The communication plan **SHALL** specify the channels to be
used for each type of communication (e.g., risk review
meeting minutes, written reports, Monitoring Plan updates,
email notifications).

#### 5.7.2 Risk Management Documentation

All risk management decisions, assessments, and
communications **SHALL** be documented and maintained in the
TMF per
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls
Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

Risk management documentation **SHALL** include:

- **Risk Management Plan**: Controlled document per
  Section 5.5, version controlled and approved per SOP-002.
  The initial version and all subsequent revisions **SHALL**
  be retained.
- **Risk Register**: Version controlled per Section 5.5.3.
  Historical versions **SHALL** be retained to document the
  evolution of the risk profile.
- **Risk assessment records**: Documentation of initial risk
  assessments (Section 5.3) and all reassessments
  (Section 6.0), including scoring rationale and acceptance
  decisions.
- **Risk review meeting minutes**: Documentation of scheduled
  and triggered risk reviews (Sections 6.1 and 6.2),
  including attendees, data reviewed, decisions made, and
  action items.
- **Risk communication records**: Documentation that risk
  information was communicated to identified stakeholders,
  including date, recipients, and content communicated.
- **QTL and KRI records**: QTL exceedance evaluations and
  KRI reports, including any resulting actions.

All documents listed above are identified in Section 9.1
(Required Records) and **SHALL** be retained per Section 9.2.

Changes to approved risk management documents during study
conduct **SHALL** follow
[SOP-013: Change Control
Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

## 6.0 PHASE 2: RISK MANAGEMENT DURING STUDY CONDUCT

This section defines the ongoing risk management activities
performed after study initiation and throughout study conduct.

Risk management during study conduct is an iterative process
(per Section 4.2.4) in which the risk profile established in
Section 5.0 is continuously evaluated against actual study
performance. Risk reviews occur through two mechanisms:
scheduled periodic reviews (Section 6.1) and event-triggered
reassessments (Section 6.2). Both mechanisms are informed by
monitoring data received from activities conducted under
SOP-009 (Section 6.3).

Updates to the risk profile during study conduct may result in
changes to the Risk Management Plan, Risk Register, QTLs, KRI
thresholds, or monitoring intensity levels. Such changes are
communicated to the monitoring team (Section 6.3.3) and may
require Monitoring Plan adaptations per SOP-009 Section 4.6.

### 6.1 Periodic Risk Review

Periodic risk reviews provide structured, scheduled
opportunities to evaluate the study risk profile against
actual study performance data. They complement the
event-triggered reassessments defined in Section 6.2.

#### 6.1.1 Scheduled Risk Reassessment

Risk reviews **SHALL** be conducted at regular intervals
throughout study conduct. The review schedule **SHALL** be
defined in the Risk Management Plan (Section 5.5) and
**SHALL** consider:

- Study duration and complexity
- Rate of enrollment and data accumulation
- Risk profile of the study (studies with more high or
  critical priority risks warrant more frequent review)

At a minimum, risk reviews **SHALL** be conducted:

- At the first scheduled review point after the first
  subject is enrolled (to confirm that pre-study risk
  assumptions are consistent with early study experience)
- At regular intervals thereafter, not to exceed quarterly
  for studies with active enrollment or data collection
- At significant enrollment milestones defined in the Risk
  Management Plan (e.g., 25%, 50%, and 75% of target
  enrollment)
- Before database lock, as a final review of the risk
  profile during study conduct

Studies with low-risk profiles or short durations **MAY**
adopt a less frequent review schedule, provided the rationale
is documented in the Risk Management Plan and the minimum
quarterly interval is maintained during active enrollment.

At each scheduled risk review, the study team **SHALL**:

- Review all open risks in the Risk Register
- Reassess likelihood and severity scores based on actual
  study data
- Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented risk controls
- Review KRI trends and QTL status
- Determine whether risk priority levels or monitoring
  intensity levels require adjustment
- Identify any new risks that have emerged since the last
  review
- Confirm that risk acceptance decisions remain appropriate
- Document the review outcomes in the Risk Register

#### 6.1.2 Risk Review Meeting Requirements

Risk reviews **SHALL** be conducted as formal meetings with
documented attendance, agenda, and outcomes.

**Attendees**

At a minimum, the following **SHALL** participate in or
provide input to risk review meetings:

- Study Director or Principal Investigator
- Risk Owners for open risks at high or critical priority
- Quality Assurance representative

Additional attendees **SHOULD** be included based on the
risks under review (e.g., data management, monitoring team,
site management, safety reviewer).

**Inputs**

The following data **SHALL** be available for review:

- Current Risk Register
- Monitoring reports and centralized monitoring summaries
  (per SOP-009 Sections 4.8.1 and 4.8.2)
- KRI and QTL status reports (per SOP-009 Section 4.8.3)
- Nonconformance log and trends (per SOP-010)
- CAPA status and effectiveness data (per SOP-011)
- Safety data review findings (per SOP-008 Section 4.9)
- Audit findings, if any (per SOP-012)
- Enrollment and study progress data

**Documentation**

Risk review meetings **SHALL** be documented in meeting
minutes that include:

- Date and attendees
- Risks reviewed and data considered
- Decisions made (score changes, control adjustments,
  new risks added, risks closed)
- Action items with responsible persons and due dates
- Updates required to the Risk Management Plan, Risk
  Register, or monitoring approach

Meeting minutes **SHALL** be maintained in the TMF per
SOP-002.

#### 6.1.3 Risk Management Plan Updates

When a risk review results in changes to the risk profile,
the Risk Management Plan and Risk Register **SHALL** be
updated to reflect the current state.

Updates **MAY** include:

- Revised risk scores (likelihood, severity, or both)
- New risks added to the Risk Register
- Risks closed or downgraded based on study data
- Modified or additional risk control measures
- Adjusted QTL thresholds or KRI definitions
- Changes to monitoring intensity levels
- Updated risk acceptance decisions

Updates to the Risk Management Plan **SHALL** be version
controlled per SOP-002. Changes that affect the study's
overall risk-based monitoring approach **SHALL** be
communicated to the monitoring team per Section 6.3.3 to
inform Monitoring Plan adaptations per SOP-009 Section 4.6.

Changes to risk management documents that are consequential
to a protocol amendment **SHALL** follow
[SOP-013: Change Control
Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md). Changes
arising solely from risk reassessment (without a protocol
amendment) **SHALL** be documented through version control
of the Risk Management Plan and Risk Register per SOP-002,
with review and approval by the Study Director or Principal
Investigator.

Summary risk status from periodic reviews **SHALL** be
available as input to the annual Management Review per
QM-001 Section 5.3.3.

### 6.2 Triggered Risk Reassessment

Certain events require risk reassessment outside the
scheduled periodic reviews defined in Section 6.1. Triggered
reassessments follow the same review activities as scheduled
reviews (Section 6.1.1) but are initiated in response to a
specific event rather than at a predetermined interval.

#### 6.2.1 Triggers for Unscheduled Risk Review

A risk reassessment **SHALL** be initiated when any of the
following events occur:

**Safety events:**
- Safety signal identified through safety data review
  (per SOP-008 Section 4.9) that may alter the study
  risk-benefit profile
- Serious adverse event that is unexpected and potentially
  related to study procedures
- Events requiring protocol modification to protect subject
  safety (per SOP-008)

**Monitoring and quality findings:**
- QTL threshold exceeded (per Section 5.6.2)
- KRI action threshold exceeded for a risk at high or
  critical priority level (per Section 5.6.4)
- Critical or major nonconformance identified
  (per SOP-010)
- Nonconformance trend indicating a potential systemic
  issue (per SOP-010 and SOP-011)
- Critical or major audit finding (per SOP-012)
- CAPA root cause analysis revealing a previously
  unidentified risk or inadequacy of existing controls
  (per SOP-011)

**Study changes:**
- Substantive protocol amendment (per SOP-013) that affects
  study procedures, eligibility criteria, endpoints, or
  the risk-benefit profile
- Significant change in study scope (e.g., addition of new
  sites, new data collection methods, change in study
  population)
- Change to a critical vendor or outsourced activity
  (per SOP-006)

**External events:**
- New regulatory requirements or guidance affecting the
  study
- External safety information relevant to study procedures
  or population
- Significant site issues (e.g., loss of key personnel,
  facility problems, regulatory action against a site)

The Study Director, Principal Investigator, Quality
Assurance, or any Risk Owner **MAY** initiate a triggered
reassessment when they become aware of a qualifying event.
The initiator **SHALL** document the triggering event and
notify the Study Director or Principal Investigator.

#### 6.2.2 Emerging Risk Identification

Risks that were not identified during pre-study planning
(Section 5.2) may emerge during study conduct. Any study
team member **SHALL** report potential emerging risks to
the Study Director or Principal Investigator.

When an emerging risk is reported, the study team **SHALL**:

- Evaluate whether the reported issue constitutes a risk
  per the definition in Section 3.3 (i.e., a combination
  of probability and severity of harm to participants,
  data integrity, or study validity)
- If confirmed as a risk, assess the risk using the
  scoring methodology defined in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2
- Assign a risk priority level per Section 5.3.3
- Associate the risk with an existing or new CTQ factor
- Determine required risk controls per Section 5.4
- Assign a Risk Owner
- Add the risk to the Risk Register with full documentation
- Determine whether the new risk requires changes to the
  monitoring approach (QTLs, KRIs, monitoring intensity)
  and communicate any changes per Section 6.3.3

If the emerging risk is at high or critical priority level,
interim risk controls **SHALL** be implemented immediately
while the full assessment is completed.

#### 6.2.3 Risk Score Adjustments

Risk scores **MAY** be adjusted during triggered
reassessment when evidence indicates that the initial
assessment no longer reflects the current risk level.

Adjustments to risk scores **SHALL** be based on objective
evidence, which **MAY** include:

- Actual occurrence data (e.g., observed deviation rates
  compared to predicted likelihood)
- Demonstrated effectiveness or ineffectiveness of
  implemented controls
- Changes to study circumstances that alter likelihood or
  severity (e.g., protocol amendment, site changes,
  population characteristics)
- Monitoring data indicating risk trends (KRI and QTL
  data per Section 6.3.1)
- Root cause analysis findings from nonconformances
  (per SOP-010) or CAPAs (per SOP-011)

Risk scores **MAY** be adjusted upward or downward.

For upward adjustments:
- If the revised priority level requires additional controls
  per Section 5.4, the study team **SHALL** define and
  implement those controls
- If the revised priority level exceeds the original
  acceptance authority, re-approval **SHALL** be obtained
  per Section 5.3.4

For downward adjustments:
- The study team **SHALL** document the evidence supporting
  the reduction
- Monitoring intensity **SHALL NOT** be reduced below the
  minimum level for the revised priority level
  (per Section 5.6.3) without documented justification
  and approval by the Study Director or Principal
  Investigator

All score adjustments **SHALL** be documented in the Risk
Register with the date, the previous and revised scores,
the evidence supporting the change, and the approving
authority. Updates to the Risk Management Plan **SHALL**
follow Section 6.1.3.

### 6.3 Integration with Monitoring Findings

This section defines the bidirectional interface between risk
management and monitoring activities conducted under
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight
Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md).

Monitoring data provides the primary evidence base for
evaluating whether identified risks are materializing or
controlled as expected. Updates to the risk profile resulting
from this evaluation are communicated back to the monitoring
team to inform adjustments to their activities.

#### 6.3.1 Monitoring Data Review for Risk Impact

Risk Owners **SHALL** review monitoring outputs to assess the
status of risks assigned to them. Monitoring outputs to be
reviewed include:

- Monitoring visit reports (per SOP-009 Section 4.8.1)
- Centralized monitoring reports, including KRI and QTL
  status (per SOP-009 Section 4.8.2)
- Management oversight reports (per SOP-009 Section 4.8.3)
- For-cause visit findings (per SOP-009 Section 4.4.3)

This review **SHALL** occur at a minimum:

- Before each scheduled risk review meeting
  (per Section 6.1.1), using the most recent monitoring
  reports as input
- Promptly upon receipt of monitoring reports that identify
  QTL exceedances, KRI action threshold breaches, or
  significant findings relevant to assigned risks

For each risk under review, the Risk Owner **SHALL** assess
whether monitoring data indicates that:

- The risk is controlled as expected (no action required)
- The risk is trending toward a higher level (score
  adjustment or additional controls may be warranted per
  Section 6.2.3)
- The risk has materialized (escalation to quality processes
  per Section 6.3.4 may be required)
- The risk is lower than initially assessed (downward score
  adjustment may be warranted per Section 6.2.3)
- Risk controls are performing as intended or require
  modification

#### 6.3.2 Updating Risk Assessments Based on Monitoring

When monitoring data indicates that risk levels differ from
current assessments, risk scores and mitigation strategies
**SHALL** be adjusted per Section 6.2.3.

Changes **SHALL** be documented in the Risk Register and, when
they affect the overall risk profile or monitoring approach,
in the Risk Management Plan per Section 6.1.3.

#### 6.3.3 Communication to Monitoring Team

Updates to the following **SHALL** be communicated to the
monitoring team to inform adjustments to monitoring activities
per SOP-009 Section 4.6:

- Risk priority levels for monitored risks
- CTQ factors (additions, removals, or modifications)
- QTL thresholds (new, revised, or removed)
- KRI definitions or thresholds
- Monitoring intensity level assignments
  (per Section 5.6.3)
- New risks requiring monitoring

Communication **SHALL** include sufficient detail for the
monitoring team to evaluate whether the Monitoring Plan
requires adaptation. The monitoring team determines the
specific operational changes to monitoring methods,
frequency, or scope per SOP-009 Section 4.6.

Communication **SHALL** be documented and maintained in the
TMF per Section 5.7.2.

#### 6.3.4 Escalation to Quality Processes

Monitoring findings or risk review outcomes that indicate
requirements have not been met **SHALL** be escalated to the
appropriate quality process:

- Findings that constitute nonconformances (protocol
  deviations, GCP violations, data integrity issues)
  **SHALL** be managed per
  [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study
  Activities
  Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md)
- Systemic issues or recurring nonconformances identified
  through risk review or trend analysis **SHALL** be
  escalated to the CAPA process per
  [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action
  Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md)
- Safety events identified through monitoring **SHALL** be
  managed per
  [SOP-008: Subject Safety and Adverse Event Management
  Procedure](SOP-008--Subject_Safety_and_Adverse_Event_Management_Procedure.md)

Risk assessments **SHALL** be updated based on:

- Root cause analyses from nonconformance reviews
  (per SOP-010) and CAPAs (per SOP-011)
- Effectiveness verification results from completed CAPAs
  (per SOP-011)
- Changes to study procedures resulting from corrective
  actions

These updates follow the risk score adjustment process in
Section 6.2.3 and are documented in the Risk Register.

## 7.0 PHASE 3: RISK MANAGEMENT AFTER STUDY COMPLETION

This section defines the risk management activities performed
after study conduct is complete, aligned with study closeout
activities per
[SOP-007: Study Closeout and Archiving
Procedure](SOP-007--Study_Closeout_and_Archiving_Procedure.md).

The focus of risk management in this phase shifts from active
risk monitoring and control to documenting risk outcomes,
evaluating the effectiveness of the risk management approach,
and capturing lessons learned to improve risk management for
future studies.

### 7.1 Final Risk Review

A final risk review **SHALL** be conducted as part of study
closeout activities per SOP-007. The final risk review
**SHALL** be completed before the Risk Management Plan and
Risk Register are finalized for archiving.

The final risk review follows the same meeting requirements
as periodic risk reviews (Section 6.1.2), with the addition
of the outcome documentation and residual risk assessment
described below.

#### 7.1.1 Risk Outcome Documentation

For each risk in the Risk Register, the study team **SHALL**
document the final outcome:

- **Realized risks**: Risks that materialized during study
  conduct. For each realized risk, document:
  - When the risk materialized and how it was detected
  - The actual impact on subject safety, data integrity,
    or study validity
  - The effectiveness of the planned controls (did
    preventive controls reduce likelihood as expected?
    did detective controls detect the issue promptly?)
  - Actions taken in response (nonconformances per SOP-010,
    CAPAs per SOP-011, protocol amendments per SOP-013)
  - Whether the initial likelihood and severity scores
    accurately predicted the actual occurrence and impact

- **Unrealized risks**: Risks that did not materialize. For
  each unrealized risk, document:
  - Whether controls were implemented as planned
  - Whether the risk was genuinely absent or whether
    controls successfully prevented it (to the extent
    this can be determined)

- **Emerging risks**: Risks identified during study conduct
  (per Section 6.2.2) that were not in the initial Risk
  Register. For each emerging risk, document:
  - When and how the risk was identified
  - Whether it could reasonably have been anticipated
    during pre-study planning

The Risk Register **SHALL** be updated with final outcomes
and a final status (realized, unrealized, or closed) for
each risk. The final Risk Register constitutes part of the
permanent study record in the TMF.

#### 7.1.2 Residual Risk Assessment

The study team **SHALL** assess whether any residual risks
remain at study completion that could affect:

- The integrity or interpretation of study data
- The safety or welfare of subjects after study
  participation ends
- The reliability of study conclusions

For each identified residual risk, the study team **SHALL**
document:

- Description of the residual risk
- Potential impact on study results or subject welfare
- Any ongoing mitigations or monitoring that remain in
  effect after study closeout (e.g., long-term follow-up
  of subjects, caveats in the final study report)
- Whether the residual risk affects the interpretation of
  study findings, and if so, how this is addressed in the
  final study report

The residual risk assessment **SHALL** be documented in the
final Risk Management Plan and provided as input to the
final study report (per SOP-007 Section 4.5).

### 7.2 Lessons Learned

The lessons learned review evaluates the effectiveness of
the risk management approach used for the study and captures
knowledge to improve risk management for future studies. This
review implements the Knowledge Management and Performance
Metrics principles defined in Section 4.2.4.

The lessons learned review **SHALL** be completed after the
final risk review (Section 7.1) and before the Risk
Management Plan is finalized for archiving.

#### 7.2.1 Risk Management Effectiveness Review

The study team **SHALL** evaluate the overall effectiveness
of the risk management approach by assessing:

**Accuracy of risk identification:**
- Were the risks that materialized anticipated in the
  initial Risk Register?
- Were significant emerging risks identified during study
  conduct (per Section 6.2.2) that should have been
  identified during pre-study planning?
- Were there CTQ factors that should have been identified
  but were not?
- Were any identified risks overestimated (resources
  allocated to risks that did not materialize and where
  controls were unnecessary)?

**Accuracy of risk scoring:**
- For realized risks, how did actual likelihood compare to
  the predicted likelihood score?
- For realized risks, how did actual impact compare to the
  predicted severity score?
- Were the scoring scales and priority thresholds
  (Section 5.3) appropriately calibrated for this study?

**Effectiveness of risk controls:**
- Which preventive controls (Section 5.4.2) were effective
  in reducing risk likelihood?
- Which detective controls (Section 5.4.3) were effective
  in identifying issues promptly?
- Were contingency plans (Section 5.4.4) activated, and if
  so, were they adequate?
- Were any controls ineffective, disproportionate, or
  impractical to implement?

**Effectiveness of risk monitoring:**
- Were QTL thresholds (Section 5.6.2) appropriately
  calibrated? Did they trigger at the right level or were
  they too sensitive or too lenient?
- Did KRIs (Section 5.6.4) provide useful early warning of
  emerging issues?
- Was the monitoring intensity (Section 5.6.3) appropriate
  for the risks encountered?

**Timeliness and responsiveness:**
- Were risks identified and escalated promptly when they
  materialized?
- Were risk reviews conducted at appropriate intervals
  (Section 6.1) and in response to qualifying events
  (Section 6.2)?
- Were updates to the monitoring approach communicated
  and implemented in a timely manner (Section 6.3.3)?

The effectiveness review **SHALL** be documented and
maintained in the TMF.

#### 7.2.2 Best Practices and Improvement Recommendations

Based on the effectiveness review, the study team **SHALL**
document:

**Best practices** — approaches that worked well and
**SHOULD** be repeated in future studies, such as:
- Risk identification methods that proved particularly
  effective
- Control measures that successfully prevented or detected
  issues
- QTL or KRI definitions that provided actionable
  information
- Communication practices that supported timely decision
  making

**Improvement recommendations** — specific, actionable
suggestions for improving risk management, such as:
- Additional risk categories or CTQ factors to consider
  in future studies
- Adjustments to scoring scales or priority thresholds
- Control measures to add, modify, or discontinue
- Changes to QTL or KRI definitions or thresholds
- Changes to risk review frequency or meeting structure
- Training needs identified through the study experience

Improvement recommendations that apply to the QMS (rather
than to a specific future study) **SHALL** be considered
for action through the appropriate process:
- Recommendations requiring changes to this procedure
  or its templates **SHALL** be submitted per SOP-013
- Recommendations indicating a systemic quality issue
  **SHALL** be evaluated for CAPA per SOP-011
- Recommendations for training **SHALL** be communicated
  to the appropriate personnel per Section 10.0

Best practices and improvement recommendations **SHALL**
be summarized and made available as input to the annual
Management Review per QM-001 Section 5.3.3.

### 7.3 Knowledge Transfer

Knowledge transfer ensures that the lessons learned and
effectiveness data from Section 7.2 are incorporated into
organizational resources that inform future studies. This
section implements the Knowledge Management principle
defined in Section 4.2.4.

#### 7.3.1 Risk Library Updates

__NewInstitute__ **SHOULD** maintain a risk library that
consolidates risk information from completed studies to
support risk identification for future studies.

After each study closeout, the study team **SHALL** review
the final Risk Register and lessons learned documentation
and identify information to contribute to the risk library,
including:

- Risks that materialized and their actual impact, with
  the controls that were or would have been effective
- Emerging risks that were not anticipated during pre-study
  planning (per Section 7.1.1), as candidates for routine
  consideration in future risk assessments
- Effective QTL and KRI definitions with calibrated
  thresholds based on actual study data
- Risk categories or CTQ factors specific to study types
  (e.g., neuroimaging studies, multi-site studies, studies
  involving vulnerable populations)

The risk library is an organizational resource, not a
study-specific document. It is maintained in QMS files
(not the TMF) and updated as studies are completed.

#### 7.3.2 Process Improvement Implementation

Improvement recommendations identified in Section 7.2.2
that were routed to QMS processes (SOP-013, SOP-011, or
training) **SHOULD** be tracked to completion.

The Study Director or Principal Investigator **SHOULD**
confirm that:

- Recommendations submitted per SOP-013 have been received
  and acknowledged
- Recommendations submitted for CAPA evaluation per
  SOP-011 have been logged
- Training recommendations have been communicated to the
  appropriate personnel

Tracking of the resulting changes, CAPAs, or training
activities is managed by the receiving process. The study
team's responsibility ends once recommendations are
submitted and acknowledged.

A summary of knowledge transfer activities, including
risk library updates and improvement recommendations
submitted, **SHOULD** be documented and maintained in the
TMF as part of the study closeout record.
