---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
identifying, assessing, controlling, communicating, and reviewing risks
associated with *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures
that risks to study participants, data quality, and study integrity are
proactively managed throughout the study lifecycle in accordance with ICH
E6(R2) quality management principles.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all risk management and quality risk management 
activities for __NewInstitue__ observational studies. It establishes the 
framework for identifying, assessing, controlling, and reviewing risks that 
could impact study quality, data integrity, and participant safety.

This procedure defines the process for:
- Identifying and documenting Critical to Quality (CtQ) factors per 
  ICH E8(R1)
- Conducting risk assessments and creating the Risk Assessment Matrix
- Developing the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that determines monitoring 
  strategies
- Establishing Risk Indicators and Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs)
- Defining risk mitigation strategies and control measures
- Conducting periodic risk reviews and updates

Key deliverables from this procedure include:
- Risk Management Plan (defines WHAT to monitor and WHY based on risk levels)
- Risk Assessment Report/Matrix
- Critical to Quality Factors documentation
- Risk mitigation strategies that inform monitoring approach

The Risk Management Plan developed under this procedure serves as a primary 
input to [SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md), 
which executes the monitoring activities identified as necessary through risk 
assessment.

Study design considerations and protocol development follow 
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

Risk management documentation is controlled under 
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

Issues identified through risk management activities that constitute 
nonconformances are managed under [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming 
Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Corrective and preventive actions arising from risk assessments are managed 
under [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors 
involved in:
- Study management and planning
- Quality assurance
- Clinical operations leadership
- Data management
- Regulatory affairs
- Study feasibility assessment

## 4.0 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Overview

__NewInstitue__ implements a risk-based quality management approach in 
accordance with ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0 to ensure the protection of study 
participants and the reliability of study results. 

Risk management activities are integrated throughout the study lifecycle across 
three phases: before study conduct (Phase 1), during study conduct (Phase 2), 
and after study completion (Phase 3). These activities are embedded within the 
QMS and interface with multiple procedures including design controls (SOP-001), 
monitoring and oversight (SOP-009), and CAPA (SOP-011).

The principles underlying this framework are detailed in Section 4.2, roles 
and responsibilities in Section 4.3, and phase-specific activities in 
Sections 5.0 through 7.0.

### 4.2 Risk Management Principles

The following principles guide risk management activities for all 
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__:

#### 4.2.1 Proportionate Approach

The level of risk management activity **SHALL** be commensurate with the risks 
to participant safety and data integrity. Risk management efforts are scaled 
based on:

- **Study Complexity**: Simple observational studies with straightforward data 
  collection may use streamlined risk assessments, while complex multi-site 
  studies with multiple endpoints require comprehensive risk analysis.

- **Participant Vulnerability**: Studies involving vulnerable populations 
  (minors, cognitively impaired, economically disadvantaged) require enhanced 
  risk consideration.

- **Data Criticality**: Studies supporting regulatory submissions or public 
  health decisions warrant more rigorous risk management than exploratory 
  research.

- **Operational Challenges**: Studies with novel procedures, inexperienced 
  sites, or challenging logistics require proportionally greater risk 
  management focus.

#### 4.2.2 Critical Process and Data Focus

Per ICH E8(R1) Section 3.2 and ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.1, risk management 
**SHALL** prioritize Critical to Quality (CTQ) factors that are essential for:

- **Participant Protection**: 
  - Informed consent processes and documentation
  - Participant eligibility and enrollment procedures
  - Safety monitoring and adverse event detection
  - Participant privacy and confidentiality protections

- **Data Reliability and Integrity**:
  - Primary endpoint data collection and processing
  - Key secondary endpoint data
  - Source documentation practices
  - Data entry and verification procedures
  - Database lock and data transfer processes

- **Study Validity**:
  - Protocol compliance for critical procedures
  - Inclusion/exclusion criteria adherence
  - Visit windows and assessment timing
  - Completeness of critical data fields

The study team **SHALL** document identified critical processes and data in the 
Risk Management Plan, with clear rationale for their designation as critical.

#### 4.2.3 Risk-Based Decision Making

Risk assessment results **SHALL** drive resource allocation and quality 
management decisions throughout the study:

- **Monitoring Strategy**: High-risk sites, procedures, or data receive 
  increased monitoring frequency and depth, while low-risk areas may use 
  reduced or remote monitoring approaches.

- **Quality Control Measures**: Enhanced controls (double data entry, 
  additional training, independent verification) are implemented for high-risk 
  processes.

- **Resource Deployment**: Experienced staff, additional oversight, and 
  enhanced tools are allocated to areas of greatest risk.

- **Contingency Planning**: Formal contingency plans are required for high 
  risks that cannot be adequately mitigated.

Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs) **SHALL** be established for critical 
parameters per ICH E6(R2) Section 5.0.3 to support objective risk-based 
decisions.

#### 4.2.4 Continuous Improvement

Risk management is an iterative process that evolves throughout the study 
lifecycle and across studies:

- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Risk profiles change as studies progress. The 
  framework **SHALL** support ongoing risk identification, reassessment, and 
  adjustment of control strategies based on:
  - Actual vs. expected study performance
  - Emerging safety signals
  - Site performance metrics
  - External factors (regulatory changes, public health events)
  - Monitoring and audit findings

- **Knowledge Management**: Lessons learned from risk outcomes **SHALL** be 
  documented and incorporated into:
  - Future study risk assessments
  - Updates to risk libraries and templates
  - Refinement of risk scoring methodologies
  - Training materials and best practices

- **Performance Metrics**: The effectiveness of risk management **SHALL** be 
  measured through:
  - Frequency of realized risks vs. predictions
  - Impact of mitigation strategies
  - Timeliness of risk identification
  - Resource efficiency in risk management

- **Process Refinement**: This procedure and associated tools **SHALL** be 
  reviewed annually and updated based on accumulated experience, regulatory 
  updates, and industry best practices.
