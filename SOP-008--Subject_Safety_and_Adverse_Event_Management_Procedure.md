## SOP-008: Subject Safety and Adverse Event Management Procedure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
monitoring subject safety and managing adverse events during *clinical
investigations* conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures prompt identification,
documentation, assessment, and reporting of safety information to protect
subject welfare.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all safety monitoring and adverse event management
activities during __NewInstitue__ clinical investigations, recognizing that
observational studies typically have different safety profiles than
interventional trials.

Safety risks are initially assessed during protocol development under
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md)

Safety events may trigger protocol amendments managed under
[SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

Safety documents and reports are controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) and maintained in the TMF.

Sites reporting safety events are qualified and overseen according to
[SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

Safety monitoring activities are part of overall study oversight under
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](todo).

This procedure applies to all NewInstitute employees and subcontractors involved in:

- Safety surveillance and monitoring
- Medical monitoring
- Clinical operations
- Data management (safety data)
- Regulatory reporting
- Site management
