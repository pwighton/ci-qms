title: "__NewInstitute__ Quality Manual"
subtitle: "SOP-008: Subject Safety and Adverse Event Management Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
monitoring subject safety and managing adverse events during *clinical
investigations* conducted by __NewInstitute__. It ensures prompt identification,
documentation, assessment, and reporting of safety information to protect
subject welfare.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to safety monitoring and adverse event management
activities for *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitute__.

For purposes of this procedure, adverse events are limited to untoward
occurrences that happen during or result from study procedures. Medical events
unrelated to study procedures are captured in source data per protocol
requirements but are not processed as study adverse events under this procedure.

Safety risks are initially assessed during protocol development under [SOP-003:
Risk Management and Quality Risk Management
Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).
The intensity of safety monitoring activities **SHALL** be proportionate to the
risks inherent in the study procedures, as determined by the risk assessment.

Reporting of safety events to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) **SHALL** be conducted per IRB/IEC-specified
requirements communicated during the approval process. At minimum, reporting
**SHALL** comply with requirements for "unanticipated problems involving risks
to subjects or others" per 45 CFR 46 and applicable OHRP guidance.

Incidental findings (clinically significant findings discovered during study
procedures that are unrelated to study objectives) **SHALL** be addressed at
the protocol level. The protocol **SHALL** specify whether and how incidental
findings will be handled, and the informed consent **SHALL** disclose this
approach to subjects. The specific approach is subject to IRB/IEC review and
approval.

A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is not required by default for observational
studies. If the protocol specifies a DMC, its operation **SHALL** be governed by
a written charter included in the Trial Master File.

Safety events may trigger protocol amendments managed under [SOP-013: Change
Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

Safety documents and reports are controlled under [SOP-002: Document and Records
Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) and
maintained in the TMF.

Sites reporting safety events are qualified and overseen according to [SOP-006:
Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

Safety monitoring activities are part of overall study oversight under [SOP-009:
Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md).

This procedure does **NOT** apply to:

- **Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) assessment**: Observational studies conducted
  under this QMS do not involve investigational products; therefore, ADR
  causality assessment and reporting do not apply.

- **FDA safety reporting under 21 CFR 312.32**: Observational studies conducted
  under this QMS are not conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND)
  application; therefore, FDA expedited safety reporting requirements do not
  apply.

- **Medical events unrelated to study procedures**: Medical events that occur
  during study participation but are unrelated to study procedures are not
  processed as adverse events under this procedure. Such events are documented
  in source data per protocol requirements and may be captured as study
  endpoints if specified in the protocol.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Safety surveillance and monitoring
- Clinical operations
- Data management (safety data)
- IRB/IEC safety reporting
- Site management

### 3.3 Terms

- **Adverse Event (AE)**: For purposes of this procedure, any untoward medical
  occurrence in a study subject that occurs during or results from a study
  procedure. This definition is specific to observational studies and differs
  from the broader ICH E6(R2) definition used for interventional trials.

- **Causality**: The assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility
  that an adverse event was caused by a study procedure.

- **Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)**: An independent committee that may be
  established to assess safety data at intervals and make recommendations
  regarding study continuation, modification, or termination. Also known as
  Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

- **Incidental Finding**: A clinically significant finding discovered during
  study procedures that is unrelated to the study objectives and was not
  anticipated as part of the research.

- **Serious Adverse Event (SAE)**: An adverse event that results in death, is
  life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of
  existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or
  incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is an
  important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or require
  intervention to prevent one of these outcomes.

- **Severity**: The intensity or magnitude of an adverse event (e.g., mild,
  moderate, severe). Severity is distinct from seriousness.

- **Seriousness**: A regulatory classification based on specific criteria
  (death, hospitalization, disability, etc.) that determines reporting
  requirements. Seriousness is distinct from severity.

- **Study Procedure**: Any activity performed as part of the research protocol
  that involves interaction with study subjects or collection of data from
  subjects. Examples include study visits, questionnaires, interviews, physical
  examinations, specimen collection, imaging procedures, and device application.

- **Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others**: Any incident,
  experience, or outcome that is (1) unexpected in nature, severity, or
  frequency; (2) related or possibly related to participation in the research;
  and (3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater
  risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. [Per OHRP Guidance]

## 4.0 PROCEDURE

### 4.1 Overview

This procedure establishes requirements for:

- Safety monitoring plan development
- Adverse event definitions and identification
- Adverse event documentation
- Severity and causality assessment
- Serious adverse event (SAE) determination
- IRB/IEC safety reporting
- Safety data review
- Safety communication to sites and subjects
- Incidental findings management
- Data Monitoring Committee operations (when applicable)

The intensity of safety monitoring activities **SHALL** be proportionate to the
risks inherent in the study procedures. Low-risk observational studies (e.g.,
questionnaire-only studies) may require minimal safety monitoring, while studies
involving invasive procedures (e.g., phlebotomy, imaging with contrast) require
more robust safety oversight.

### 4.2 Safety Monitoring Plan

#### 4.2.1 Requirements

Each study protocol **SHALL** include a safety monitoring plan or safety
section that addresses:

- Study procedures that pose potential risk to subjects
- Types of adverse events to be collected
- Procedures for identifying, documenting, and reporting adverse events
- Severity and causality assessment methods
- IRB/IEC reporting requirements and timelines
- Approach to incidental findings (if applicable)
- Need for Data Monitoring Committee (if applicable)
- Roles and responsibilities for safety monitoring

The safety monitoring plan **SHALL** be developed during protocol development
(SOP-001 Section 5.3) and informed by the risk assessment conducted per SOP-003.

#### 4.2.2 Proportionate Approach

The scope and intensity of safety monitoring **SHALL** be proportionate to:

- Nature and invasiveness of study procedures
- Vulnerability of the study population
- Duration and frequency of subject contact
- Known risks associated with study procedures
- Study setting (clinical vs. community)

For minimal-risk studies (e.g., surveys, interviews, review of existing data),
the safety monitoring plan may be abbreviated, documenting the rationale for
limited safety monitoring.

#### 4.2.3 Review and Approval

The safety monitoring plan **SHALL** be reviewed as part of the Protocol Review
per SOP-005 and approved by the IRB/IEC before study initiation.

### 4.3 Adverse Event Definitions

#### 4.3.1 Adverse Event (AE)

For purposes of this procedure, an **Adverse Event (AE)** is any untoward
medical occurrence in a study subject that occurs during or results from a
study procedure.

Examples of procedure-related adverse events include:

- Bruising, hematoma, or infection at venipuncture site
- Vasovagal response during blood draw
- Allergic reaction to contrast agent during imaging
- Anxiety or distress during study assessments
- Breach of confidentiality resulting in harm
- Physical injury during study visit

Medical events that occur during study participation but are unrelated to study
procedures (e.g., subject develops influenza, is diagnosed with unrelated
condition) are **NOT** considered adverse events under this procedure. Such
events are documented in source data per protocol requirements.

#### 4.3.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

A **Serious Adverse Event (SAE)** is any adverse event (as defined in 4.3.1)
that:

- Results in death
- Is life-threatening
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
- Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect
- Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or require
  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

The seriousness criteria are applied only to events that meet the adverse event
definition (i.e., events occurring during or resulting from study procedures).

#### 4.3.3 Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others

An **Unanticipated Problem** is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets
ALL THREE of the following criteria:

1. **Unexpected**: The nature, severity, or frequency was not previously known
   or recognized
2. **Related or possibly related**: There is a reasonable possibility that the
   incident is related to study procedures
3. **Suggests greater risk**: The incident suggests that the research places
   subjects or others at greater risk of harm than was previously known or
   recognized

Unanticipated problems require prompt reporting to the IRB/IEC regardless of
whether they meet the definition of a serious adverse event.

### 4.4 Adverse Event Identification and Documentation

#### 4.4.1 Identification

Adverse events **SHALL** be identified through:

- Direct observation by study personnel during study procedures
- Subject self-report during or after study procedures
- Review of source documents and medical records (if applicable)
- Follow-up contact with subjects (if specified in protocol)

The protocol **SHALL** specify the time period during which adverse events are
collected (e.g., during study visit only, 24 hours following procedure, duration
of study participation).

#### 4.4.2 Documentation

All adverse events **SHALL** be documented with the following information:

- Subject identifier
- Description of the event
- Date and time of onset
- Date and time of resolution (or ongoing status)
- Severity assessment
- Causality assessment (relationship to study procedures)
- Seriousness determination
- Action taken
- Outcome
- Reporter identification and date

Adverse events **SHALL** be documented on the adverse event case report form
(CRF) or in the designated section of the study database per SOP-004.

Documentation **SHALL** occur as soon as practicable after the event is
identified, and no later than the timeframe specified in the protocol.

### 4.5 Severity Assessment

#### 4.5.1 Severity Grading

Adverse event severity **SHALL** be assessed using a standardized grading scale.
Unless the protocol specifies otherwise, the following scale **SHALL** be used:

| Grade | Severity | Definition |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Mild | Awareness of symptoms; easily tolerated; no interference with usual daily activities |
| 2 | Moderate | Discomfort sufficient to interfere with usual daily activities |
| 3 | Severe | Incapacitating; inability to perform usual daily activities |

The protocol **MAY** specify an alternative severity grading scale appropriate
to the study procedures and population.

#### 4.5.2 Distinction from Seriousness

Severity describes the intensity of an event. Seriousness describes whether the
event meets regulatory criteria for serious adverse events (Section 4.3.2).
These are independent assessments:

- A mild event may be serious (e.g., brief hospitalization for observation)
- A severe event may not be serious (e.g., severe but transient pain)

### 4.6 Causality Assessment

#### 4.6.1 Relationship to Study Procedures

Causality **SHALL** be assessed relative to study procedures only. The
assessment determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse
event was caused by a study procedure.

The following categories **SHALL** be used:

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Related | There is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by a study procedure. Evidence includes temporal relationship, plausible mechanism, and lack of alternative explanation. |
| Possibly Related | There is some evidence suggesting a relationship to a study procedure, but alternative explanations exist or the relationship is uncertain. |
| Not Related | There is no reasonable possibility that the event was caused by a study procedure. The event has a clear alternative etiology or no plausible connection to study procedures. |

#### 4.6.2 Causality Determination

Causality **SHALL** be assessed by qualified study personnel as specified in
the protocol (e.g., Principal Investigator, Study Physician, or designated
qualified individual).

Factors to consider in causality assessment include:

- Temporal relationship (event occurred during or shortly after study procedure)
- Plausible mechanism (known risk of the study procedure)
- Absence of alternative explanation
- Response to discontinuation of procedure (if applicable)
- Rechallenge (if applicable and ethically appropriate)
- Consistency with known risks of the procedure

### 4.7 Serious Adverse Event Processing

#### 4.7.1 Identification of SAEs

When an adverse event is identified, study personnel **SHALL** promptly assess
whether the event meets the seriousness criteria defined in Section 4.3.2.

If the event meets any seriousness criterion, it **SHALL** be processed as a
serious adverse event.

#### 4.7.2 SAE Documentation

Serious adverse events **SHALL** be documented with all information required for
adverse events (Section 4.4.2), plus:
