subtitle: "SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
identifying, documenting, evaluating, and managing activities that do not
conform to protocol requirements, GCP standards, or regulatory requirements
during *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all nonconforming activities identified during the
conduct of __NewInstitue__ *observational studies*.

Nonconformances are often identified through
[SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure](SOP-009--Monitoring_and_Oversight_Procedure.md)
activities.

Root cause analysis and systemic corrections of nonconformances are managed
under [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md).

Documentation of nonconformances is controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md)
and maintained in the TMF.

Major nonconformances may trigger amendments managed under
[SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

Vendor-related nonconformances are addressed with
[SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Identifying nonconforming activities
- Reviewing and assessing deviations
- Clinical operations management
- Quality assurance
- Data management
- Regulatory affairs
- Study management

### 4.1 Overview

This procedure establishes the systematic process for managing nonconforming 
activities identified during the conduct of observational studies. 
Nonconformances are activities, processes, or outcomes that fail to meet 
protocol requirements, GCP standards per ICH E6(R2), regulatory requirements, 
or established procedures.

The nonconformance management process includes:

- **Identification**: Recognition and reporting of nonconformances from any 
  source (monitoring, audits, self-reporting, data review, external 
  notifications)
- **Assessment**: Classification of severity and evaluation of impact on 
  subject safety and data integrity
- **Containment**: Immediate actions to prevent continuation or recurrence
- **Disposition**: Determination of appropriate corrective actions and data 
  handling decisions
- **Documentation**: Recording per ICH E6(R2) Section 5.20 requirements
- **Communication**: Notification to relevant parties based on severity and 
  regulatory requirements
- **Escalation**: Elevation to CAPA process (SOP-011) for systemic issues or 
  to management/regulatory authorities for critical nonconformances
- **Tracking**: Maintenance of nonconformance log for trend analysis and 
  quality metrics

Common types of nonconformances include: 
- Protocol deviations
- GCP violations
- Consent issues
- Eligibility violations
- Data integrity issues
- Safety reporting failures
- Training deficiencies

Not all findings constitute nonconformances - performance issues or
observations that do not violate requirements are managed through other quality processes.

Systemic issues identified through nonconformance trends are escalated to 
the CAPA process (SOP-011). Updates to risk assessments based on 
nonconformance patterns are managed under SOP-003.

### 4.2 Definition of Nonconformance

A nonconformance is any activity, process, or outcome that fails to meet:
- Protocol requirements
- GCP standards per ICH E6(R2)
- Applicable regulatory requirements
- Approved SOPs or work instructions
- Informed consent requirements
- Data integrity standards

Nonconformances do NOT include:
- Performance below expectations (unless requirements violated)
- Potential risks that haven't materialized
- Recommendations for improvement

### 4.3 Roles and Responsibilities

(Who can identify, who reviews, who approves dispositions)

## 5.0 IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT

### 5.1 Identification and Initial Documentation

Nonconformances **MAY** be identified through:
- Monitoring activities (per SOP-009)
- Risk review activities (per SOP-003)
- Quality audits (per SOP-012)
- Self-reporting by study personnel
- Data management or medical review
- External notifications (IRB, regulatory, vendor)

### 5.2 Classification and Severity Assessment

#### 5.2.1 Classification Categories

(Minor, Major, Critical based on impact to safety/data integrity)

#### 5.2.2 Impact Assessment

(Evaluate effect on subject safety, data integrity, study validity)

### 5.3 Immediate Actions and Containment
(Stop the nonconformance from continuing or spreading)

### 5.4 Review and Disposition

#### 5.4.1 Disposition Options
(Accept as-is, correct, exclude data, etc.)

#### 5.4.2 Approval Requirements
(Who must approve based on severity)

### 5.5 Documentation Requirements
(What must be documented per ICH E6(R2) Section 5.20)

## 6.0 COMMUNICATION AND ESCALATION

### 6.1 Internal Communication
(Study team, management, QA notifications)

### 6.2 External Reporting Requirements
(IRB, regulatory authorities per ICH E6(R2) 5.20)

### 6.3 Escalation to Other Processes
(When to trigger SOP-011 CAPA, SOP-003 Risk Management updates)

## 7.0 TRACKING AND TRENDING

### 7.1 Nonconformance Log
(Central tracking of all nonconformances)

### 7.2 Metrics and Trend Analysis
(Identify patterns requiring systemic action)

### 7.3 Periodic Review
(Regular review of nonconformance trends with management)

## 8.0 RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION

### 8.1 Required Records
(List of documents to maintain in TMF)

### 8.2 Record Retention
(Per SOP-002 requirements)
