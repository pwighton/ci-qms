subtitle: "SOP-012: Internal and External Audit Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes requirements for planning,
conducting, and reporting internal audits of quality management system
processes and *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitute__.

This procedure is based on the principles of ISO 19011:2018 and satisfies the
audit requirements of ICH E6(R2) Section 5.19.

This procedure ensures that:

- Audits are conducted by qualified individuals independent from the activities
  being audited
- Audit findings are documented and reported accurately
- Audit results provide input for corrective and preventive actions and
  continuous improvement

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to internal audits of __NewInstitute__ quality
management system processes and *observational studies*.

Internal audits include audits of QMS processes (system audits) and audits of
individual study conduct (study audits). The audit programme determines audit
frequency and priorities based on risk and management objectives.

__NewInstitute__ is not currently subject to external regulatory inspections or
third-party certification audits. If this changes, this procedure will be
revised to address external audit and inspection readiness.

Audit findings requiring systemic correction are managed under
[SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md).

Audit documentation is controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

Risk assessments informing audit planning use
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).

Audits of external organizations are coordinated with
[SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ personnel involved in:

- Planning and managing audit programmes
- Conducting audits
- Responding to audit findings (as auditees)
- Quality assurance oversight
