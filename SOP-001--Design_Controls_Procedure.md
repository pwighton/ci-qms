subtitle: "SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides *minimum*
requirements (requirements are expressed using the word **shall**)
for the design of *observational studies* by
__NewInstitue__.  It ensures that study designs are appropriately planned,
verified, validated, and controlled to meet scientific objectives while
maintaining subject safety, privacy and data integrity.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all design and development activities for
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__,  organized according to 
the three temporal phases defined in ICH E6(R2) Section 8:

-   **Phase 1**: Before the Conduct of the Trial (primary focus of this SOP)
-   **Phase 2**: During the Conduct of the Trial (brief coverage with references to other SOPs)
-   **Phase 3**: After Completion or Termination of the Trial (brief coverage with references to other SOPs)

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
involved in study design activities.

Design changes during the development phase are managed under this procedure.
Changes to approved protocols and study documents after design approval are
managed under [SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

This procedure defines how to develop study designs through systematic phases 
from concept to final deliverables. Formal review meetings, approval authorities, 
and go/no-go decision gates at key milestones are managed under 
[SOP-005: Study Design Review Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md).
