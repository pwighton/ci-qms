## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides *minimum*
requirements (requirements are expressed using the word **shall**)
for the design of *observational studies* by
__NewInstitue__.  It ensures that study designs are appropriately planned,
verified, validated, and controlled to meet scientific objectives while
maintaining subject safety, privacy and data integrity.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all design and development activities for *clinical
investigations* up to final approval, including but not limited to:

- Development of clinical study concepts and objectives
- Scientific and feasibility assessments
- Protocol development and amendments
- Case Report Form (CRF) design
- Data collection tool design and specification
- Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) development
- Study-specific procedure development
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning for study design
- Design verification and validation activities
- Design review and approval processes

Design changes during the development phase are managed under this procedure.
Changes to approved protocols and study documents after design approval are
managed under [SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

This procedure defines how to develop study designs through systematic phases 
from concept to final deliverables. Formal review meetings, approval authorities, 
and go/no-go decision gates at key milestones are managed under 
[SOP-005: Study Design Review Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Study concept development
- Protocol writing
- Statistical planning
- Data collection tool design
- Clinical operations planning
- Quality assurance reviews
- Regulatory affairs
- Data management system design
