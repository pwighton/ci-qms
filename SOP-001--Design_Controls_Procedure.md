subtitle: "SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides *minimum*
requirements (requirements are expressed using the word **SHALL**)
for the design of *observational studies* by
__NewInstitue__.  It ensures that study designs are appropriately planned,
verified, validated, and controlled to meet scientific objectives while
maintaining subject safety, privacy and data integrity.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all design and development activities for
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__,  organized according to 
the three temporal phases defined in ICH E6(R2) Section 8:

-   **Phase 1**: Before the Conduct of the Study (primary focus of this SOP)
-   **Phase 2**: During the Conduct of the Study (brief coverage with references to other SOPs)
-   **Phase 3**: After Completion or Termination of the Study (brief coverage with references to other SOPs)

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
involved in study design activities.

Design changes during the development phase are managed under this procedure.
Changes to approved protocols and study documents after design approval are
managed under [SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

This procedure defines how to develop study designs through systematic phases 
from concept to final deliverables. Formal review meetings, approval authorities, 
and go/no-go decision gates at key milestones are managed under 
[SOP-005: Study Design Review Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md).

## 4.0 DESIGN CONTROL PROCESS

### 4.1 Overview

This section provides high-level requirements and documentation for design 
control across all three temporal phases

-   **Phase 1**: Before the conduct of the study
-   **Phase 2**: During the conduct of the study
-   **Phase 3**: After Completion or Termination of the study

The primary focus of this SOP is on Phase 1 activities.

### 4.2 Roles and Responsibilities

**todo:** Define key roles (e.g Study Director/PI, Protocol Author, Statistician, Data Manager, Quality Reviewer, Approvers, etc.

### 4.3 Design Controls Framework

This SOP implements a design controls framework based on ISO-9001:2015 and ICH
E6(R2) principles to ensure systematic development of observational study
designs. The framework follows a structured approach from initial concept
through final approval and study initiation.

The design controls framework consists of the following key elements:

**Design Inputs --> Design Outputs --> Verification --> Validation --> Transfer**

**Design Inputs** are the requirements and constraints that form the basis for
study design. Design inputs include:
- Scientific objectives and research questions
- Regulatory and ethical requirements
- Subject population characteristics
- Available resources and infrastructure
- Risk considerations and critical-to-quality factors
- Stakeholder requirements

Design inputs are documented in Section 5.2 and inform all subsequent design
activities.

**Design Outputs** are the documented results of the design process that
address design inputs. Design outputs include:
- Study Protocol
- Statistical Analysis Plan
- Case Report Forms and data collection specifications
- Informed consent forms
- Regulatory and ethics documentation
- Supporting documentation (data management plan, system specifications, etc.)

Design outputs are produced throughout Phase 1 (Sections 5.2 through 5.5) and
**SHALL** address all design input requirements.

**Design Verification** (Section 5.6) confirms that design outputs meet design
input requirements. Verification activities answer the question: "Did we build
it right?" Verification ensures that:
- All design inputs are addressed in design outputs
- Design outputs are complete, accurate, and internally consistent
- Documentation meets regulatory and quality standards

**Design Validation** (Section 5.7) confirms that the study design is fit for
its intended purpose and capable of meeting study objectives. Validation
activities answer the question: "Did we build the right thing?" Validation
ensures that:
- The study design will generate data suitable for addressing research
  questions
- Study procedures are feasible and executable
- The overall design will produce reliable, interpretable results

**Design Transfer** (Section 5.8) is the process of transitioning the completed
and validated design from the design team to the study conduct team. Design
transfer includes:
- Final design approval and authorization to initiate the study
- Protocol signature by all required parties
- Site initiation and training
- System transfer to production environment
- Handoff of all documentation and materials

**Traceability** is maintained throughout the design process to demonstrate
that:
- All design inputs are addressed in design outputs
- Design outputs have been verified and validated
- Changes are documented and controlled
- The complete design history is preserved

**Design Reviews** are conducted at key decision gates per SOP-005 to assess
design progress, identify issues, and make go/no-go decisions. Reviews are
integrated throughout Sections 5.2 through 5.8.

**Design Changes** during Phase 1 are managed under this procedure. Changes
after study initiation (Phase 2) are managed per SOP-013: Change Control
Procedure.

This framework ensures that observational study designs are systematically
developed, thoroughly reviewed, and properly validated before study initiation,
supporting the generation of high-quality, reliable scientific data.

### 4.4 Essential Documents

Design control activities produce essential documents and records that are
maintained in the Trial Master File (TMF) or in QMS records. Essential
documents are organized by the three temporal phases defined in ICH E6(R2)
Section 8 (before the study, during the study, after the study).

A complete listing of essential documents and records, including their purpose
and detailed SOP section references, is described below in Sections 5, 6 and 7.

Not all documents listed below will be applicable to every 
*observational study*. The study protocol **SHALL** identify which documents are
required for that specific study.
