## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
managing investigational products used in *observational studies* conducted
by __NewInstitue__. It ensures proper accountability, storage, handling, and
documentation throughout the product lifecycle.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all investigational products used in __NewInstitue__
*observational studies*.

For the purposes of this SOP, "investigational products" refers to any materials, 
devices, or products provided to study participants specifically for research 
data collection purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, biospecimen 
collection materials, wearable devices, diagnostic tests, and any other items 
distributed to participants as part of the study protocol.

Products received from vendors are managed according to

for vendor qualification.  Routine clinical procedures performed external sites 
are (e.g., phlebotomy, imaging, clinical assessments) also covered by [SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md)

Documentation of product management is controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md)
with records maintained in the TMF.

Product-related deviations (e.g., temperature excursions) are managed under
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Risk assessment for product management is performed using
