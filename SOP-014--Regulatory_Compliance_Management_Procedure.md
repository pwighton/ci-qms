## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes requirements for maintaining
regulatory compliance throughout *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitute__.

Because study results are intended to support future FDA submissions, this
procedure ensures compliance with:

- 45 CFR 46: Protection of Human Subjects (Common Rule)
- 21 CFR 54: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators

This procedure ensures that:

- IRB/IEC approval is maintained throughout study conduct
- Financial disclosure information is collected and maintained for all
  investigators
- Regulatory documents are current and complete in the Trial Master File
- Regulatory commitments are tracked and fulfilled

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to regulatory compliance activities for *observational
studies* conducted by __NewInstitute__.

This procedure covers:

- IRB/IEC compliance management (continuing review, study status reporting,
  study closure notifications)
- Financial disclosure collection and maintenance per 21 CFR Part 54
- Regulatory document management and TMF maintenance
- Regulatory commitment tracking

Initial IRB/IEC submission and approval is managed under
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

Protocol amendments and IRB/IEC approval of changes are managed under
[SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

Safety reporting to the IRB/IEC is managed under
[SOP-008: Subject Safety and Adverse Event Management Procedure](SOP-008--Subject_Safety_and_Adverse_Event_Management_Procedure.md).

Protocol deviations and IRB/IEC deviation reporting are managed under
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Study closeout and final IRB/IEC notifications are managed under
[SOP-007: Study Closeout and Archiving Procedure](SOP-007--Study_Closeout_and_Archiving_Procedure.md).

Regulatory documents are controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md)
and maintained in the TMF.

__NewInstitute__ observational studies are not conducted under an Investigational
New Drug (IND) application; therefore, FDA communications and reporting
requirements under 21 CFR Part 312 do not apply. If this changes, this procedure
will be revised to address FDA submission and communication requirements.

__NewInstitute__ is not currently subject to regulatory inspections. If this
changes, this procedure will be revised to address inspection readiness and
management.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Regulatory affairs
- Clinical operations
- Principal Investigators and sub-investigators
- Quality assurance
