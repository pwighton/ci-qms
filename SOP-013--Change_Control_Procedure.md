## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
managing changes to approved *observational study* documents, systems, and
processes conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures that all changes are
assessed for impact, properly reviewed, approved, implemented, and documented
to maintain study integrity and compliance.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to protocol amendments and consequential document changes
for *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitute__ after study
initiation.

For purposes of this procedure, a **protocol amendment** is a written
description of a change to or formal clarification of an approved protocol, per
ICH E6(R2) Section 1.45.

This procedure applies after:

- Final Design Approval per [SOP-005: Study Design Review
  Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md)
- Protocol signature per [SOP-001: Design Controls
  Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md) Section 5.8.3
- Study initiation (first subject enrolled)

This procedure covers:

- **Protocol amendments**: Changes to the approved study protocol, including
  changes to objectives, study design, eligibility criteria, study procedures,
  endpoints, sample size, or other protocol content

- **Consequential document changes**: Changes to other controlled documents
  that are driven by a protocol amendment, including:
  - Informed consent form revisions
  - Case Report Form (CRF) modifications
  - Statistical Analysis Plan updates
  - Data Management Plan updates
  - Other study documents affected by the protocol change

  Consequential document changes **SHALL** be processed together with the
  protocol amendment as a package.

This procedure does **NOT** apply to:

- **Design phase changes**: Changes to protocol and study documents before
  study initiation are managed under [SOP-001: Design Controls
  Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

- **Protocol deviations**: Unplanned departures from the approved protocol are
  managed under [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study
  Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).
  This includes deviations implemented to eliminate immediate hazards to
  subjects per ICH E6(R2) Section 4.5.4. If a deviation reveals the need for a
  protocol amendment, SOP-010 **SHALL** trigger this procedure.

- **Standalone document changes**: Changes to controlled documents that are not
  driven by a protocol amendment (e.g., typographical corrections to CRFs,
  administrative updates) are managed under [SOP-002: Document and Records
  Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

- **QMS document changes**: Changes to Quality Management System documents
  (SOPs, quality manual, forms) are managed under [SOP-002: Document and
  Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Protocol development and amendment
- Clinical operations
- Regulatory affairs
- IRB/IEC submissions
- Site management
- Data management
- Biostatistics

### 3.3 Terms

- **Administrative Amendment**: A protocol amendment that involves only
  logistical or administrative aspects of the study and does not affect subject
  safety, study scope, scientific quality, or subject rights. Administrative
  amendments do not require IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation. Also
  referred to as a non-substantive amendment.

- **Consequential Document Change**: A change to a controlled study document
  (e.g., informed consent form, CRF, SAP) that is necessitated by and directly
  results from a protocol amendment.

- **Protocol Amendment**: A written description of a change(s) to or formal
  clarification of a protocol. [ICH E6(R2) Section 1.45]

- **Protocol Deviation**: An unplanned departure from the IRB/IEC-approved
  protocol that is not prospectively authorized by the sponsor. Deviations are
  managed under SOP-010, not this procedure.

- **Substantive Amendment**: A protocol amendment that affects subject safety,
  study scope, scientific quality, or the rights of subjects. Substantive
  amendments require IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation.

- **CRF**: Case Report Form
- **DMP**: Data Management Plan
- **IEC**: Independent Ethics Committee
- **IRB**: Institutional Review Board
- **PI**: Principal Investigator
