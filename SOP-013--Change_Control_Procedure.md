# __NewInstitue__ Quality Manual
## SOP-013: Change Control Procedure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
managing changes to approved *clinical investigation* documents, systems, and
processes conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures that all changes are
assessed for impact, properly reviewed, approved, implemented, and documented
to maintain study integrity and compliance.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all changes affecting approved *clinical
investigations* and quality system components after initial approval.

This procedure manages changes to study designs that were initially developed
under [SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md)
and approved under [SOP-005: Study Design Review Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md).

This procedure manages the complete change control process (impact assessment,
approval, implementation) for all study modifications after approval. It may
use review  criteria from SOP-005 to ensure consistent evaluation standards, but
this procedure owns the full change management workflow from request to closure.

Changes identified through nonconformances, deviations, or CAPA activities are
initiated through [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Clinical Investigation
Activities Procedure](todo) or [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](todo)
and managed through this procedure.

This procedure does not apply to changes to *clinical investigations* in the
design phase (before they have received final approval).  Changes to *clinical
investigations* in the design phase are managed by [SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all NewInstitute employees and subcontractors involved
in:

- Requesting or identifying needed changes
- Assessing change impacts
- Reviewing and approving changes
- Implementing approved changes
- Communicating changes to affected parties
