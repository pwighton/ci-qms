subtitle: "SOP-013: Change Control Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
managing changes to approved *observational study* documents, systems, and
processes conducted by __NewInstitue__. It ensures that all changes are
assessed for impact, properly reviewed, approved, implemented, and documented
to maintain study integrity and compliance.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to protocol amendments and consequential document changes
for *observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitute__ after study
initiation.

For purposes of this procedure, a **protocol amendment** is a written
description of a change to or formal clarification of an approved protocol, per
ICH E6(R2) Section 1.45.

This procedure applies after:

- Final Design Approval per [SOP-005: Study Design Review
  Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md)
- Protocol signature per [SOP-001: Design Controls
  Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md) Section 5.8.3
- Study initiation (first subject enrolled)

This procedure covers:

- **Protocol amendments**: Changes to the approved study protocol, including
  changes to objectives, study design, eligibility criteria, study procedures,
  endpoints, sample size, or other protocol content

- **Consequential document changes**: Changes to other controlled documents
  that are driven by a protocol amendment, including:
  - Informed consent form revisions
  - Case Report Form (CRF) modifications
  - Statistical Analysis Plan updates
  - Data Management Plan updates
  - Other study documents affected by the protocol change

  Consequential document changes **SHALL** be processed together with the
  protocol amendment as a package.

This procedure does **NOT** apply to:

- **Design phase changes**: Changes to protocol and study documents before
  study initiation are managed under [SOP-001: Design Controls
  Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

- **Protocol deviations**: Unplanned departures from the approved protocol are
  managed under [SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study
  Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).
  This includes deviations implemented to eliminate immediate hazards to
  subjects per ICH E6(R2) Section 4.5.4. If a deviation reveals the need for a
  protocol amendment, SOP-010 **SHALL** trigger this procedure.

- **Standalone document changes**: Changes to controlled documents that are not
  driven by a protocol amendment (e.g., typographical corrections to CRFs,
  administrative updates) are managed under [SOP-002: Document and Records
  Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

- **QMS document changes**: Changes to Quality Management System documents
  (SOPs, quality manual, forms) are managed under [SOP-002: Document and
  Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Protocol development and amendment
- Clinical operations
- Regulatory affairs
- IRB/IEC submissions
- Site management
- Data management
- Biostatistics

### 3.3 Terms

- **Consequential Document Change**: A change to a controlled study document
  (e.g., informed consent form, CRF, SAP) that is necessitated by and directly
  results from a protocol amendment.

- **Expedited Review**: A review procedure permitted under 45 CFR 46.110 for
  minor changes in previously approved research, conducted by the IRB
  chairperson or one or more experienced reviewers designated by the
  chairperson, rather than by the full IRB board.

- **Minor Amendment**: A protocol amendment that does not affect subject safety,
  study scope, scientific quality, or subject rights. Minor amendments require
  IRB/IEC review before implementation but may be eligible for expedited review
  per 45 CFR 46.110. Examples include typographical corrections, updates to
  contact information, and changes to administrative personnel.

- **Protocol Amendment**: A written description of a change(s) to or formal
  clarification of a protocol. [ICH E6(R2) Section 1.45]

- **Protocol Deviation**: An unplanned departure from the IRB/IEC-approved
  protocol that is not prospectively authorized by the sponsor. Deviations are
  managed under SOP-010, not this procedure.

- **Substantive Amendment**: A protocol amendment that affects subject safety,
  study scope, scientific quality, or the rights of subjects. Substantive
  amendments require full IRB/IEC board review and approval before
  implementation. Examples include changes to eligibility criteria, study
  procedures, endpoints, or informed consent content affecting subject rights.

## 4.0 PROCEDURE

### 4.1 Overview

This procedure establishes requirements for:

- Classifying protocol amendments as substantive or administrative
- Developing and documenting amendments with rationale and impact assessment
- Internal review and approval before IRB/IEC submission
- IRB/IEC submission and approval (for substantive amendments)
- Implementation of approved amendments
- Communication to sites
- Subject re-consent when amendments affect informed consent
- Documentation and TMF maintenance

All protocol amendments **SHALL** be processed according to this procedure
before implementation, except as noted for administrative amendments.

### 4.2 Amendment Classification

#### 4.2.1 Classification Requirement

All proposed protocol changes **SHALL** be classified to determine the
appropriate review pathway.

determination. Quality Assurance **MAY** review classification determinations
for consistency.

Classification determines:

- Whether full IRB/IEC board review or expedited review is appropriate
- Internal review requirements
- Implementation timing

#### 4.2.2 Substantive Amendments

A **substantive amendment** is a protocol change that affects subject safety,
study scope, scientific quality, or the rights of subjects.

Examples of substantive amendments include, but are not limited to:

- Changes to study objectives or endpoints
- Changes to study design or methodology
- Changes to eligibility criteria (inclusion/exclusion)
- Changes to study procedures that affect subject risk or burden
- Changes to sample size
- Changes to study duration or follow-up period
- Addition or removal of study sites
- Changes to safety monitoring procedures
- Changes to data collection that affect primary or secondary endpoints
- Changes affecting the risk-benefit profile
- Changes to the informed consent that affect subject rights or understanding

Substantive amendments require:

- Internal review per Section 4.4
- Full IRB/IEC board review and approval before implementation per 45 CFR
  46.108(b)

#### 4.2.3 Minor Amendments

A **minor amendment** is a protocol change that does not affect subject safety,
study scope, scientific quality, or subject rights.

Examples of minor amendments include, but are not limited to:

- Correction of typographical errors
- Updates to contact information (telephone numbers, addresses, email)
- Changes to administrative personnel (monitor, project manager)
- Clarifications that do not change meaning or intent
- Formatting or organizational changes that do not alter content

Minor amendments require:

- Internal review per Section 4.4 (may be limited to Principal Investigator
  review)
- IRB/IEC review before implementation; may be eligible for expedited review
  per 45 CFR 46.110

Note: Under 45 CFR 46.110, "minor changes in previously approved research" may
be reviewed through an expedited procedure by the IRB chairperson or designated
experienced reviewer, rather than requiring full board review. The IRB/IEC
determines whether a proposed change qualifies for expedited review.

#### 4.2.4 Classification Criteria

The following criteria **SHALL** be considered when classifying amendments:

| Criterion | Substantive | Minor |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Subject safety | Affects risk to subjects | No effect on risk |
| Subject rights | Affects rights or consent | No effect on rights |
| Study scope | Changes objectives, endpoints, or population | No change to scope |
| Scientific quality | Affects data integrity or study validity | No effect on quality |
| Study procedures | Changes subject experience or burden | Administrative only |

If there is uncertainty regarding classification, the amendment **SHALL** be
treated as substantive and submitted for full IRB/IEC board review.

#### 4.2.5 Classification Documentation

The classification determination **SHALL** be documented with:

- Classification category (substantive or minor)
- Rationale for classification, addressing the criteria in Section 4.2.4
- Name and role of person making determination
- Date of determination

Classification documentation **SHALL** be included in the amendment package
submitted to the IRB/IEC.

#### 4.2.6 IRB/IEC Determination

The IRB/IEC has final authority to determine:

- Whether a proposed change qualifies as minor and is eligible for expedited
  review
- The appropriate review pathway for any amendment
- Whether additional information is required to assess the amendment

If the IRB/IEC determines that a change classified as minor by the study team
requires full board review, the study team **SHALL** comply with the IRB/IEC
determination.

### 4.3 Amendment Development
