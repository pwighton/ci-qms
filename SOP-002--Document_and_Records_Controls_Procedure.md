---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
creating, reviewing, approving, distributing, maintaining, and archiving
documents and records related to *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitue__. It ensures document integrity, traceability and compliance with
regulatory requirements.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all controlled documents and records generated or
received during the design, conduct, and reporting of *observational studies*

Documents and records created during study design are initially developed under
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md) and
reviewed under [SOP-005: Study Design Review Procedure](SOP-005--Study_Design_Review_Procedure.md),
but their format, control, and maintenance are governed by this procedure.

The format, control and maintenance of documents and records created during the
conduct of the study are also governed by this procedure, however the creation 
of those documents and records are governed by other various procedures. Refer
to [Setion 8.0 of the Quality Manual](QM-001--QualityManual.md#80-measurements-analysis-and-improvement)
for specifics.

When documents and records are created, stored, or maintained in electroni
systems, those systems SHALL comply with the requirements of
[SOP-004: Computer System Validation, Data Integrity and Data Management Procedure](SOP-004--Computer_System_Validation_Data_Integrity_and_Data_Management_Procedure.md).

### 3.2 __NewInstitue__ References 

### 3.3 Terms

-   **Document**: Controlled information that provides instructions,
    requirements, or specifications for performing work. Documents are expected
    to evolve over time, with revisions subject to formal review and approval
    processes. Examples include SOPs, work instructions, study protocols,
    and plans.

-   **Record**: Fixed evidence of activities performed or results achieved.
    Records are created at a point in time and, once completed, are not altered
    except through formal correction processes. Records provide objective
    evidence that work was performed in accordance with established procedures
    and requirements. Examples include completed case report forms, signed
    informed consent forms, training records, and test results.

-   **Study Protocol**: A document that describes the objective(s), design,
    methodology, statistical considerations, and organization of a trial.

## 4.0

An effective document and records control system is the foundation of
the QMS. Document and records control provides consistency throughout
the design and conduct of an *observational study*. Part of establishing an
effective document and records control process requires establishing a central
document and records repository that is readily accessible to staff members. In
addition, document and records control provides support to internal and
external auditors and inspectors by providing official copies of
controlled documents and records for review.

Documents and records serve different functions within the QMS and are managed
accordingly:

-   **Documents** are controlled information that is expected to evolve over
    time. Examples include SOPs, work instructions, protocols, and plans.
    Documents undergo formal revision processes, with each revision requiring
    review and approval before release. Documents provide instructions or
    requirements for how work should be performed.

-   **Records** are fixed evidence of activities performed or results achieved.
    Examples include completed case report forms, informed consent forms,
    meeting minutes, training records, and test results. Records are created at
    a point in time and are not altered after completion (except through formal
    corrections as described in Section 5.3.5). Records provide objective
    evidence that work was performed according to documented procedures and
    requirements.

Essential requirements of an effective document and records control
system include:

-   Maintenance of a Master List of all controlled documents

-   Document numbering and revision scheme

-   Basic document format and content, including the requirement to
    identify appropriate records that provide evidence specific work was
    done

-   Minimum set of review and approval signatures required on documents
    before they become approved

-   Requirements for changing documents once approved

-   Record retention policy for documents and records

-   Removal of obsolete documents from point of use

## 4.1 Responsibilities

The __NewInstitue__ QA representative is the focal point for the
document and record control system and is responsible for assuring
that all applicable documents and records conform to this SOP.

All __NewInstitue__’s employees and third parties working under the
direction of __NewInstitue__ are responsible for creating documents and
records in a manner consistent with the requirements of this SOP.

Required documents and records are submitted to the document control
system and **shall** only be released by the QA representative.

The __NewInstitue__ Project Manager is responsible for assuring that
all required documents and records are identified in the Study
Protocol and are created at the appropriate time during the project.

The Project Manager is responsible for assuring that documents and
records created by third parties working at the direction of
__NewInstitue__ are consistent with this SOP.

The Project Manager **shall** be responsible for ensuring that all
project activities are performed based only on documents that have
been formally reviewed, approved and released through document
control.

## 4.2 Document Identification and Numbering

Every document **shall** have a unique identifier.

The QA representative **shall** maintain a document log. All
persons creating documents **shall** request a unique document identifier from
the QA representative.

In addition to a unique document identifier, each document **shall** have
a revision. Revision numbers are as follows: ZZ where ZZ is a number
from 00-99. The initial revision of a new document is 00.

## 4.3 Initial Document Creation

The QA representative maintains a document template that includes all
required elements including:

-   Document title on every page

-   Document number and revision on every page

-   Page number on every page

-   Confidentiality statement on every page

-   __NewInstitue__ logo on every page

-   Record of Revisions block

-   Table of Contents

-   Required signatures (typically, author, reviewer and approver)

-   Effective date (cover page only)

All persons creating documents should use this document template.

## 4.4 Initial Document Review and Approval

All new and revised documents are reviewed and approved by one or more
persons prior to being released to ensure the accuracy and adequacy of
the information. The author and those persons reviewing and approving
the document **shall** sign and date the document prior to release as
follows:

-   Author: reviews and signs the document indicating accountability for
    the content of the document.

-   Approver: One or more approvers reviews and signs the document
    indicating that the information has been reviewed and the
    information that is being released is adequate and sufficient for
    the intended purpose. All approvers **shall** be selected based on
    their technical ability to understand the document content.

-   QA: The __NewInstitue__ QA representative reviews and signs all
    documents, making sure the document complies with the requirements
    of this procedure and is sufficient to meet its intended use.

The document is released through document control prior to being
distributed or implemented within or outside __NewInstitue__. Approved
documents **shall** be made available at all locations for which they
are designated, used, or otherwise necessary.

All obsolete revisions of documents **shall** be promptly removed from
all points of use or otherwise prevented from unintended use.

The effective date of a document is indicated on the document cover
page.

## 4.5 Approval of Changes

The person assigned to change a released document is responsible for:

-   Requesting an editable electronic copy of the released version of
    the document to be changed from the __NewInstitue__ QA representative

-   Providing a “marked up" (i.e., using track changes tool) electronic
    version of the proposed revision to the __NewInstitue__ QA
    representative, who will review the proposed changes and ask for
    clarifications or additional information if needed.

-   Providing a concise description of the changes being made to the
    document in the “Revision History” block. When not prescribed by the
    document format, the description of the change must be provided in
    the change control forms.

All proposed changes are reviewed and either accepted or rejected
using the following criteria:

-   Changes are documented and justified

-   Consequences of changes are evaluated from a risk perspective

-   Approved changes are verified after they have been implemented

Once the QA representative deems the document ready for review, an
electronic copy **shall** be sent to the reviewers and approvers. All
comments are returned to the QA representative who works with the
author to resolve them.

All changes **shall** be reviewed and approved either by the original
approver or by another person that has access to pertinent background
information upon which to base their decisions.

When all comments and issues are resolved, the QA representative
circulates the final draft for the required approval signatures.

All document changes are formally released through document control
and the document revision number is incremented.

## 4.6 Availability of documents

Released documents are communicated to the appropriate personnel in a
timely manner. Documents are intended to be available at all locations
for which they are designated, used or otherwise necessary. This is
accomplished through the use of posting controlled copies of current
documents on the company intranet or project wiki page or some similar
mechanism.

## 4.7 Documents of external origin

Documents of external origin, required for the quality system or
related to the product, are identified and controlled within the
__NewInstitue__ document control system. The QA representative
**shall** control their distribution.

Examples of documents of external origin include:

-   Required regulatory documents and related standards

-   Vendor specifications, part number descriptions, catalogues or other
    external documents that are used to purchase items for use in
    __NewInstitue__ products

## 4.8 Removal of obsolete documents

Obsolete documents **shall** be promptly removed from all points of
use as part of the document distribution process.

## 4.9 Retention of obsolete documents

The original copies of obsolete controlled documents shall be retained for the
same period as essential study documents, which is at least two (2) years after
the formal discontinuation of the study or as required by applicable regulatory
requirements, whichever is longer. (`ICH E6(R1) 5.5.11`)

## 4.10 Master Documents and Controlled Copies

Document control retains the signed copy of all released
documents. These Master Documents are preserved for a retention period
defined above and used only for the purpose of generating controlled
copies.

Controlled copies are an electronic version of a master document. They
are a true and accurate representation of the master copy. They are
created using a documented work instruction that is maintained by the
QA representative. It **shall** not be possible to alter or modify
controlled copies.

All controlled copies are so labeled and can be used as the basis for
performing work related to the design and development of medical
devices.

## 4.11 Master Document List

The QA representative manages a list of all controlled documents
including their unique identifier, title and revision. Only current document
revisions are displayed on the master list. The QA representative is
able to produce a master document list at any time. Superseded
and obsolete documents have expiry dates corresponding with the date
that they were made obsolete or replaced by a newer revision.

# 5 RECORD CONTROL PROCESS

The record control process establishes requirements for the creation,
control storage, and retention of records. This procedure applies to
all records required to demonstrate conformity of study conduct  and the
quality system including but not limited to records in the following
categories:

-   Study Files (including protocol, amendments, and administrative documents)

-   Risk Management Files (RMF)

-   Regulatory Records

-   Informed Consent Records

-   Subject Records (including case report forms, source documentation, and eligibility verification)

-   Data Management Records

-   Adverse Event and Safety Records

-   Quality Records (including audit reports, deviations, and corrective actions)

-   Training Records

-   Monitoring Records 

-   Laboratory and Testing Records (if applicable)

-   Vendor/Contractor Records (including agreements and qualifications)

## 5.1 General

Records are established to provide evidence that products, processes
and the quality system conform to QMS requirements.

Records are created as part of performing a task, operation, or
activity called out in SOPs, work instructions or Study Protocol.

The QA representative maintains all required records in secure electronic 
systems that comply with applicable regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11)
or as paper records in locked, fireproof storage. The  Study Protocol
**shall** document the location and format of study-specific records.

## 5.2 Required Content

All records **shall** include, at a minimum, the following
information:

-   Project or product the record is associated with

-   Information required by SOP, work instruction or project plan

-   Signature and printed name of person creating record

-   Date (and where appropriate, time) record was created

## 5.3 Good Record Keeping Practices

The objective of good record keeping practices is to consistently
produce complete and understandable records. Good record keeping is
most apparently important when being audited. If the records are
complete and understandable then auditors will have no reason to ask
questions beyond their planned ones.

After being trained to this procedure, employees will understand how
to consistently produce clear unambiguous records.

This procedure is applicable to all __NewInstitue__ employees when
creating or modifying any Design History File (DHF), Device Master
Record (DMR), or Quality System Record (QSR).

### 5.3.1 Requirements for Creating Records

The following rules **shall** be followed when creating records:

-   All handwritten entries on documents must be made using permanent
    blue ink.

-   Entries must be made as soon as is practical after completion of a
    step or a process.

-   All entries must be made directly on the official record
    or document.

-   Signatures made by pre-printed labels or photocopies are
    not permitted.

-   Signatures received by fax are acceptable.

-   All blank spaces must be explained by a procedure or
    be self-evident.

-   All required fields on a form must be filled in to demonstrate that
    the required information was considered by the person completing the
    record

-   If an entry is not completed because it is not applicable, it is to
    be annotated with the abbreviation for Not Applicable (NA or N/A).

### 5.3.2 Signature and Initial Entries

The following rules **shall** be followed when signing and initialing records:

-   When a signature is required, it must be accompanied by the date the
    signature was applied.

-   When signing as a
    delegate, the signature is annotated to indicate the printed name of
    the person signing and a note indicating that they are signing on
    the named person’s behalf.

-   The use of initials is allowed when approval or signature is
    not specified.

-   No one **shall** enter a signature for someone else unless
    officially delegated and qualified to do so.

### 5.3.3 Delegation of Signing Authority

The following rules **shall** be followed regarding delegating signing authority:

-   A person’s direct reporting superior is always authorized to sign
    for that person. The approver is required to clearly print
    their name.

-   A person may delegate anyone deemed qualified. The delegate is
    responsible to consider if they are qualified to make the approval.
    Signing authority can be delegated by notifying the QA
    representative in writing.

-   The notification **shall**:

  -   list the delegates full name
    
  -   describe a restricted time frame for the delegation
    
  -   be approved by the delegator.

### 5.3.4 Date and Time Entries

The following rules **shall** be followed regarding date and time entries:

-   The date and time hand written on a document will be the current
    date and time at the location where the handwritten entry is made.

-   The time is recorded only when required to do so by the form or
    related procedure.

-   The format to be used for the date on documents is: 2-digit day,
    three character month, 4-digit year. Alternately a 2-digit year may
    be used.

-   Backdating (entering a date on a day after the entry was made or the
    task was performed) is not permitted under any circumstances.

-   Postdating (entering a date in the future) is not permitted under
    any circumstances.

-   An entry of a time value may be made using the 24 or 12-hour
    clock notation. For the 12 hour clock notation, the abbreviations am
    and pm may be written in any of the following forms; (a.m., p.m.),
    (am, pm), (A.M., P.M.) or (AM, PM).

### 5.3.5 Modifying Records

The following rules **shall** be followed regarding modifying records:

-   Corrections are to be made by the person who created the
    record originally.

-   Correction by writing over the existing entry is not permitted.

-   When a record requires correction:

-   a single line is to be drawn through the entire incorrect entry in
    such a way that the information is still legible

-   the correct information is appended

-   the correction is initialed and dated.

-   A brief explanation is required to be included near the correction.

-   When space limitations do not allow for the explanation to be
    located near the correction, place an asterisk or number in a circle
    next to the corrected entry and write the explanation at the bottom
    of the page. The explanation, identified by the asterisk or
    corresponding number, must be approved.

-   If an entry is not completed at the time the function is performed,
    it is to be treated as a correction when it is entered.

### 5.3.6 Attachments

When using attachments to complete a record the attachment must have
a unique, traceable identifier on each page with appropriate
references to permit traceability to the record it belongs to. A
device, such as the page numbering format “page X of Y”, must be
included to assure that the attachment is complete.
