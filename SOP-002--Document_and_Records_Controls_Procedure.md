regulatory requirements.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all controlled documents and records generated or
received during the design, conduct, and reporting of *observational studies*

but their format, control, and maintenance are governed by this procedure.

The format, control and maintenance of documents and records created during the
conduct of the study are also governed by this procedure, however the creation 
of those documents and records are governed by other various procedures. Refer
