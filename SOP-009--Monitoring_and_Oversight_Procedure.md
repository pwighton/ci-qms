subtitle: "SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
monitoring and oversight of *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitue__. It ensures that studies are conducted in accordance with the
protocol, GCP, and regulatory requirements while maintaining data quality and
subject safety.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to the execution and documentation of all monitoring 
and oversight activities for __NewInstitue__ observational studies. It 
implements the risk-based monitoring approach defined in the Risk Management 
Plan to ensure studies are conducted in accordance with the protocol, GCP, 
and regulatory requirements while maintaining data quality and participant 
safety.

This procedure defines the process for:
- Developing the Monitoring Plan based on the Risk Management Plan
- Executing on-site, remote, and centralized monitoring activities
- Conducting Source Data Verification (SDV) per risk-based strategies
- Generating monitoring visit reports and tracking findings
- Measuring and reporting site performance metrics and KPIs
- Escalating issues identified during monitoring
- Maintaining monitoring documentation and schedules

Key deliverables from this procedure include:
- Monitoring Plan (defines HOW, WHEN, WHERE, and WHO performs monitoring)
- Monitoring Visit Reports
- Remote/Centralized Monitoring Reports
- Site Performance Metrics/KPI Reports
- SDV documentation
- Issue logs and escalation reports

This procedure implements the monitoring strategies determined by the Risk 
Management Plan developed under [SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk 
Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md). 
The Monitoring Plan operationalizes the risk-based approach by translating 
risk levels and Critical to Quality factors into specific monitoring 
activities.

Study protocols being monitored are developed under 
[SOP-001: Design Controls Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

Sites being monitored are qualified according to 
[SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

Monitoring reports and documentation are controlled under 
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) 
and maintained in the TMF.

Monitoring findings that identify nonconformances are managed under 
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Issues requiring corrective action are managed under 
[SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md), 
which tracks actions through completion and verification of effectiveness.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors 
involved in:
- Clinical monitoring activities
- Study management and oversight
- Data management (for centralized monitoring)
- Quality assurance
- Site management
- Clinical operations leadership
