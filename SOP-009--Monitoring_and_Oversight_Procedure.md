title: "__NewInstitute__ Quality Manual"
subtitle: "SOP-009: Monitoring and Oversight Procedure"
---

## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
monitoring and oversight of *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitute__. It ensures that studies are conducted in accordance with the
protocol, GCP, and regulatory requirements while maintaining data quality and
subject safety.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to the execution and documentation of all monitoring
and oversight activities for *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitute__. It implements the risk-based monitoring approach defined in
the study's Risk Management Plan to ensure studies are conducted in accordance
with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements while
maintaining data quality and subject safety.

This procedure applies to monitoring of:

- **External clinical sites**: Sites and investigators qualified per [SOP-006:
  Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md)
  that perform study-related activities including subject enrollment, data
  collection, and study procedures

- **Internal data collection activities**: Data collection conducted directly
  by __NewInstitute__ or through direct-to-subject mechanisms, including
  wearable devices, mobile applications, electronic patient-reported outcomes,
  and other digital health technologies

The monitoring approach for each study is determined based on the Risk
Management Plan developed under [SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk
Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).
The Monitoring Plan operationalizes the risk-based approach by translating
identified risks and critical to quality factors into specific monitoring
activities proportionate to study complexity and risk.

Study protocols being monitored are developed under [SOP-001: Design Controls
Procedure](SOP-001--Design_Controls_Procedure.md).

Monitoring reports and documentation are controlled under [SOP-002: Document
and Records Controls
Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) and maintained
in the TMF.

Monitoring findings that identify nonconformances are managed under [SOP-010:
Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities
Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Issues requiring corrective action are managed under [SOP-011: Corrective and
Preventive Action
Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md).

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitute__ employees and subcontractors
involved in monitoring and oversight activities.

  other than the sites at which the study is being conducted. Centralized
  monitoring processes may include statistical analyses to identify data trends,
  site performance issues, or data anomalies.

  threaten the protection of human subjects or the integrity of study results.
  Examples include data related to informed consent, eligibility criteria, study
  endpoints, and safety assessments.

- **Critical Process**: A process that if not performed or performed incorrectly
  would threaten the protection of human subjects or the integrity of study
  results.

- **For-Cause Visit**: An unscheduled on-site monitoring visit triggered by
  specific concerns identified through centralized monitoring, performance
  metrics, or other sources.

- **Key Risk Indicator (KRI)**: A metric used to monitor identified risks and

- **Remote Monitoring**: Monitoring activities conducted without physical presence
  at the study site, such as telephone or video communication with site personnel
  and remote review of documents.

- **Site Initiation Visit (SIV)**: A visit conducted before enrollment begins at a

  that all prerequisites for study conduct are in place.

- **Source Data**: All information in original records and certified copies of
  original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a
  study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study.
  [ICH E6(R2) 1.51]
