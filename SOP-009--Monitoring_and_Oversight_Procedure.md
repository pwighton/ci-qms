## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
monitoring and oversight of *observational studies* conducted by
__NewInstitue__. It ensures that studies are conducted in accordance with the
protocol, GCP, and regulatory requirements while maintaining data quality and
subject safety.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all monitoring and oversight activities for
NewInstitute *observational studies*, utilizing risk-based monitoring
approaches appropriate for each *observational study*.

The risk-based monitoring approach is developed using
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).

Monitoring findings may identify nonconformances managed under
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Sites being monitored are qualified according to
[SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

Monitoring reports and documentation are controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) and maintained in the TMF.

Issues identified during monitoring requiring corrective action are managed
under [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md), 
which tracks actions through completion and verification of effectiveness.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
involved in:

- Clinical monitoring activities
- Study management and oversight
- Data management (for centralized monitoring)
- Quality assurance
- Site management
- Clinical operations leadership
