## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for

subject safety.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all monitoring and oversight activities for

Monitoring findings may identify nonconformances managed under
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md).

Sites being monitored are qualified according to
[SOP-006: Outsourced Activities Procedure](SOP-006--Outsourced_Activities_Procedure.md).

Monitoring reports and documentation are controlled under
[SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md) and maintained in the TMF.

Issues identified during monitoring requiring corrective action are managed
under [SOP-011: Corrective and Preventive Action Procedure](SOP-011--Corrective_and_Preventive_Action_Procedure.md), 
which tracks actions through completion and verification of effectiveness.

This procedure applies to all __NewInstitue__ employees and subcontractors
