## 1.0 PURPOSE

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes the systematic approach for
implementing corrective and preventive actions to address systemic issues,
prevent recurrence of nonconformances, and drive continuous improvement in
*observational studies* conducted by __NewInstitue__.

## 2.0 SCOPE

This procedure applies to all corrective and preventive actions arising from
quality issues, trends, or risks identified during __NewInstitue__
*observational studies* and QMS operations.

Individual nonconformances are initially managed under
[SOP-010: Control of Nonconforming Observational Study Activities Procedure](SOP-010--Control_of_Nonconforming_Observational_Study_Activities_Procedure.md),
with systemic issues escalated to this CAPA procedure.

CAPAs may result in changes managed under [SOP-013: Change Control Procedure](SOP-013--Change_Control_Procedure.md).

CAPA documentation is controlled under [SOP-002: Document and Records Controls Procedure](SOP-002--Document_and_Records_Controls_Procedure.md).

Risk-based decisions for CAPA priorities use
[SOP-003: Risk Management and Quality Risk Management Procedure](SOP-003--Risk_Management_and_Quality_Risk_Management_Procedure.md).

Audit findings requiring CAPA are identified through
[SOP-012: Internal and External Audit Procedure](SOP-012--Internal_and_External_Audit_Procedure.md).
